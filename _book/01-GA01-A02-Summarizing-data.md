## Guided Activity 1:  Intro to Data Analysis

\setstretch{1}

### Learning outcomes

* Identify observational units, variables, and variable types in a statistical study. 
  
* Creating a data set

* Creating a plot of the data

* Calculating a summary statistic of the data

### Terminology review
Statistics is the study of how best to collect, analyze, and draw conclusions from data.  This week in class you will be introduced to the following terms:
  
* Observational units or cases

* Variables: categorical or quantitative 

For more on these concepts, read Chapter 1 in the textbook.

#### Further analysis of class data set {-}

1. What are the observational units or cases for the data collected in class on day 1?
  
  \vspace{0.3in}

2. How many observations are reported in the data set? This is the **sample size**.

3. The header for each column in the data set describes each variable measured on the observational unit. For each column of data, fill in the following table identifying the type of each variable, and if the variable is categorical whether the variables is binary and if the variable is quantitative the units of measure used.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|p{1.5in}|p{0.5in}|p{0.5in}|} \hline
Column & Type of Variable & Binary? & Units? \\ \hline
Major & & &\\
& & & \\ \hline
Residency & & & \\
& & & \\ \hline
Num Credits & & & \\
& & & \\ \hline
Dominant hand & & & \\
& & & \\ \hline
Hand Span & & & \\
& & & \\ \hline
Grip strength dominant hand & & & \\
& & & \\ \hline
Grip strength non-dominant hand & & & \\
& & & \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

4. Review the completed data set with your table.  Remember that when creating a data set for use in R it is important to use single words or an underscore between words.  Each outcome must be written the same way each time to have consistency between responses.  Do not include units of measure in the data set when reporting numerical values.  Write down some issues found with the created class data set.

#### Summary Statistics {-}

5. Brainstorm with your table on ways to summarize the variable `Residency` both visually and mathematically.  Write down your tables ideas.

\vspace{1.5in}

6.  Your instructor will use RStudio (a statistical software package) to create a graph and numerical summaries of the variable `Residency`. Draw the graph created here.

7.  Your instructor will use RStudio to find the count for each level of the variable `Residency`. Calculate the proportion of Stat 216 students that have in-state residency.

8. Brainstorm with your table on ways to summarize the variable `Grip_Strength_Dominant` both visually and mathematically.  Write down your table's ideas.

\vspace{1.5in}

9. Your instructor will use RStudio to create a graph and numerical summaries of the variable `Grip_Strength_Dominant`.  Draw the graph created here.

### Take-home messages

1. There are two types of variables: categorical (groups) and quantitative (numerical measures).

2. We will learn more about summarizing variable later in the semester.  Categorical variables are summarized by calculating a proportion from the data and quantitative variables are summarized by finding the mean and the standard deviation.

### Additional notes

Use this space to summarize your thoughts and take additional notes on today's activity and material covered, and to write down the names and contact information of your teammates.
