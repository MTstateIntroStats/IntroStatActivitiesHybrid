## Module 7 and 8 Review 

1. Women are considered anemic if they have a hemoglobin level of less than 12.0 g/dl. An iron supplement manufacturer reports that they can increase the level of hemoglobin by 1.5 g/dl. If the supplement does not work, there will be no change in the hemoglobin level.  The researchers believe the mean change in hemoglobin level for all women is 2 g/dl from the true mean change in hemoglobin level, on average.  The manufacturer plans to use a significance level of 0.01 and hold the probability of concluding that the supplement does not increase the hemoglobin level, when really it does to 10%.  

a.  What values would we enter into the power applet to find the minimum sample size needed?

* Null Hypothesis Value $\mu_0$:

* Alternative Hypothesis direction:

* True value of $\mu$:

* Type I Error $\alpha$:

\vspace{0.1in}

* Population Std. Dev. $\sigma$:

b.  What is the desired power of the test?

\vspace{2.5in}

c.  The results from the power applet indicate a minimum sample size of 23 would be needed.  If the manufacturer used a sample size of 40, would the power of the test increase or decrease?

* What if a significance level of 0.05 was used?

d.  Interpret the power of the test in context of the study.

2. Two widely used antidepressants for major depressive disorder (MDD) are escitalopram and sertraline. In this study, 211 people diagnosed with MDD were recruited to participate in an eight-week trial. They were randomly assigned to receive either escitalopram or sertraline, without the inclusion of a placebo. At the end of the eight weeks, participants were evaluated using the Clinical Global Impression – Improvement scale (CGI-I). The CGI-I ranges from 1 to 7, where a score of 1-2 indicates there has been some level of improvement in the participant’s mental health. The results of the study are reported in the table and plot below.  Is there evidence of a difference in likelihood of some level of improvement for people diagnosed with MDD between those taking escitalopram and those taking sertraline? Use Escitalopram – Sertraline as the order of subtraction.

|               | Escitalopram | Sertraline |  Total   |
|---------------|--------------|------------|----------|
| Improvement   |      75      |     83     |   158    |   
| No Improvement|      29      |     24     |    53    |  
| Total         |     104      |    107     |   211    |

3. Research was carried out to explore whether the method of studying, either individually or in a group, has any significant impact on a student’s final exam performance, specifically whether they pass or fail. The data for this study were gathered from a sample of 200 undergraduate students in an Introductory Chemistry class who voluntarily participated by reporting their study habits and exam outcomes (pass or fail) after their first midterm. The results of the study are reported in the table below.  Is there evidence of an association between how undergraduate students choose to study and their exam results?  Use Group – Individual as the order of subtraction.


|            |    Group     | Individual |  Total   |
|------------|--------------|------------|----------|
| Pass       |      73      |     59     |   132    |   
| Fail       |      30      |     38     |    68    |  
| Total      |     103      |     97     |   200    | 


a.  Calculate the proportion of students that failed the final exam among those that studied in a group.  Use proper notation with appropriate subscripts.
