### Probability {-}

Example: Two variables were collected on a random sample of people who had ever been married; whether a person had ever smoked and whether a person had ever been divorced. The data are displayed in the following table. This survey was based on a random sample in the United States in the early 1990s, so the data should be representative of the adult population who had ever been married at that time. 

* Let event D be a person has gone through a divorce

* Let event S be a person smokes

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline
\hspace{0.8in} & \hspace{0.35in} Has divorced \hspace{.35in} & \hspace{0.35in} Has never divorced  \hspace{0.35in} & \hspace{0.3in} Total \hspace{0.3in} \\

* Event: something that could occur, something we want to find the probability of

    * Getting a four when rolling a fair die

* Complement: opposite of the event

    * Getting any value but a four when rolling a fair die

* The probability of an event is the ______________ proportion of times the event would occur if the ________________ process were repeated indefinitely.

    * For example, the probability of getting a four when rolling a fair die is ___________.

* Unconditional probabilities

    * An ____________________probability is calculated from the entire population not_____________________________
    on the occurrence of another event.

    * Examples:

        * The probability of a single event

            * The probability a selected Stat 216 student is a computer science major.

        * An “And” probability

            * The probability a selected Stat 216 student is a computer science major and a freshman.

* Conditional probabilities

    * A _____________________ probability is calculated
_______________________ on the occurrence of another event.

    * Examples:

        * The probability of event A given B

            * The probability a selected freshman Stat 216 student is a computer science major.

        * The probability of event B given A

            * The probability a selected computer science Stat 216 student is a freshman

#### Creating a hypothetical two-way table {-}

Steps:

* Start with a large number like 100000.  

* Then use the unconditional probabilities to fill in the row or column totals. 

* Now use the conditional probabilities to begin filling in the interior cells.  

* Use subtraction to find the remaining interior cells.

* Add the column values together for each row to find the row totals.

* Add the row values together for each column to find the column totals.

Example:  An airline has noticed that 30\% of passengers pre-pay for checked bags at the time the ticket is purchased.  The no-show rate among customers that pre-pay for checked bags is 5\%, compared to 15\% among customers that do not pre-pay for checked bags.

* Let event B = customer pre-pays for checked bag
* Let event N = customer no shows

<!-- * Interpretation: -->

<!--     * The proportion of successes in group 1 is the $RR$ ________________ the proportion of successes in group 2. -->

<!-- Increase in risk: -->

<!-- \vspace{0.3in} -->

<!-- * Interpretation: -->

<!--     * The proportion of successes in group 1 is the $(RR-1)$ ______________  -->
<!-- higher/lower than the proportion of successes in group 2. -->

<!-- Percent increase in risk: -->

<!-- \vspace{0.3in} -->

<!-- * Interpretation: -->

<!--     * The proportion of successes in group 1 is the $(RR-1)\times 100$ __________ higher/lower than the proportion of successes in group 2. -->

<!-- Example for class discussion: In a study reported in the New England Journal of Medicine [@doit2015], one-hundred fifty (150) children who had shown sensitivity to peanuts were randomized to receive a flour containing a peanut protein or a placebo flour for 2.5 years. At age 5 years, children were tested with a standard skin prick to see if they had an allergic reaction to peanut protein (yes or no). 71% of those in the peanut flour group no longer demonstrated a peanut allergy compared to 2% of those in the placebo group. -->

<!-- * Calculate the relative risk of desensitization comparing the peanut flour group to the placebo group. -->

<!-- Within the peanut flour group, the percent desensitized within each age group (at start of study) is as follows: -->

<!-- 1-year-olds: 71\%; 2-year-olds: 35\%; 3-year-olds: 19\% -->

<!-- * Calculate the relative risk of desensitization comparing the 3 year olds to the 2 year olds within the peanut flour group.  -->

<!-- * What was the calculated relative risk of developing shingles when comparing those who has mild COVID-19 to those who had not had COVID-19, among the 50 and older population? -->
