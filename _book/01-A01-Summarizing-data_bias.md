## Activity 1:  Intro to Data Analysis and Sampling Bias

\setstretch{1}

### Learning outcomes

* Identify observational units, variables, and variable types in a statistical study. 
  
* Creating a data set

* Identify biased sampling methods.

### Terminology review
Statistics is the study of how best to collect, analyze, and draw conclusions from data.  In the next few days of class, we will learn the building blocks of the semester.  This week in class you will be introduced to the following terms:
  
* Observational units or cases

* Variables: categorical or quantitative 

* Selection bias

* Response bias

* Non-response bias

For more on these concepts, read Chapter 1 and 2 in the textbook.

### Notes on Observational Units and Variables {-}

#### Further analysis of class data set {-}

1. What are the observational units or cases for the data collected in class on day 1?
  
  \vspace{0.3in}

2. How many observations are reported in the data set? This is the **sample size**.

3. The header for each column in the data set describes each variable measured on the observational unit. For each column of data, fill in the following table identifying the type of each variable.

* If the variable is categorical, indicate in column 3 whether the variable is binary.

* If the variable is quantitative, indicate in column 4 the units of measure used.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|p{1.5in}|p{0.5in}|p{0.5in}|} \hline
Column & Type of Variable & Binary? & Units? \\ \hline
Major & & &\\
& & & \\ \hline
Residency & & & \\
& & & \\ \hline
Num Credits & & & \\
& & & \\ \hline
Dominant hand & & & \\
& & & \\ \hline
Hand Span & & & \\
& & & \\ \hline
Grip strength dominant hand & & & \\
& & & \\ \hline
Grip strength non-dominant hand & & & \\
& & & \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

4. Review the completed data set with your class.  Remember that when creating a data set for use in R it is important to use single words or an underscore between words.  Each outcome must be written the same way each time to have consistency between responses.  Do not include units of measure in the data set when reporting numerical values.  Write down some issues found with the created class data set.

Complete Q5 together as a class:

5. A television station is interested in predicting whether or not local voters will pass a referendum to legalize marijuana for adult.  The TV station asks its viewers to phone in and indicate whether they are in favor or opposed to the referendum.  Of the 2241 viewers who phoned in, forty-five percent were opposed to legalizing marijuana.

6. To determine if the proportion of out-of-state undergraduate students at Montana State University has increased in the last 10 years, a statistics instructor sent an email survey to 500 randomly selected current undergraduate students.  One of the questions on the survey asked whether they had in-state or out-of-state residency.  She only received 378 responses.

7. To gauge the interest of Bozeman City Voters in a new swimming pool, a local organization stood outside of the Bogart Pool in Bozeman, MT, during open hours.  One of the questions they asked was, "Since the Bogart Pool is in such bad repair, don't you agree that the city should fund a new pool?"

### Take-home messages

1. There are two types of variables: categorical (groups) and quantitative (numerical measures).

2. We will learn more about summarizing variable later in the semester.  Categorical variables are summarized by calculating a proportion from the data and quantitative variables are summarized by finding the mean and the standard deviation.

3.  There are three types of bias to be aware of when designing a sampling method: selection bias, non-response bias, and response bias.
