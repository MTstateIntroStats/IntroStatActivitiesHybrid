#### Notes {-}

Big Idea: Variability is inevitable!  We would not expect to get _exactly_ 50 heads in 100 coin flips.  The statistical question then is whether any differences found in data are due to random variability, or if something else is going on.  

> The larger the difference, the **less we believe the difference was due to chance.**

How many types of variables are discussed?  Explain the differences between them and give an example of each.

True or False: A pair of variables can be both associated AND independent.  
True or False: Given a pair of variables, one will always be the explanatory variable and one the response variable.  
True or False: If a study does have an explanatory and a response variable, that means changes in the explanatory variable must **cause** changes in the response variable. 

True or False: Observational studies can show a naturally occurring association between variables.  

#### Example (Section 1.1 --- Case study: Using stents to prevent strokes) {-}

1.	What is the principle question the researchers hope to answer?  (We call this the **research question**.)
\rgs
\rgs


2.	When creating two groups to compare, do the groups have to be the same size (same number of people in each)?
\rgs
\rgs

3.	What are the cases or observational units in this study?
\rgs
\rgs


4.	Is there a clear explanatory and response variable?  If so, name the variable in each role and determine the type of variable (discrete, continuous, nominal, or ordinal).
\rgs
\rgs


5.	What is the purpose of the control group?
\rgs
\rgs


6.	Is this an example of an observational study or an experiment?  How do you know?
\rgs
\rgs



7.	Consider Tables 1.1 and 1.2.  Which table is more helpful in answering the research question?  Justify your answer.
\rgs
\rgs


8.	Describe in words what is shown in Figure 1.1.  Specifically, compare the proportion of patients who had a stroke between the treatment and control groups after 30 days as well as after 365 days.

9.	Given the notion that the larger the difference between the two groups (for a given sample size), the less believable it is that the difference was due to chance, which measurement period (30 days or 365 days) provide stronger evidence that there is an association between stents and strokes, or that the differences are not due to random chance?
\rgs
\rgs


10.	This study reported finding evidence that stents *increase* the risk of stroke.  Does this conclusion apply to all patients and all stents?
\rgs
\rgs

11.	This study reported finding evidence that stents *increase* the risk of stroke.  This conclusion implies a causal link between stents and an increased risk of stroke.  Is that conclusion valid?  Justify your answer.

#### Notes {-}

Ideally, how should we sample cases from our target population?  Using what sampling method? 
\rgs

##### Notes on types of sampling bias {-}

* Someone must first be _chosen_ to be in a study and refuse to participate in order to have **non-response bias**.

* There must be a valid reason for someone to lie or be untruthful to justify saying **response bias** is present.  Yes, anyone could lie at any time to any question.  Response bias is when those lies are predictable and systematic based on outside influences.
\rgs


True or False: Convenience sampling tends to result in non-response bias.

True or False: Volunteer sampling tends to result in response bias.

True or False: Random sampling helps to resolve selection bias, but has no impact on non-response or response bias.
