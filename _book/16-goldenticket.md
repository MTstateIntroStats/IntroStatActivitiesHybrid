## Golden Ticket to Descriptive and Inferential Statistical Methods

In this course, we have covered descriptive (summary statistics and plots) and inferential (hypothesis tests and confidence intervals) methods for five different scenarios:

* one categorical response variable
* two categorical variables
* one quantitative response variable or paired differences in a quantitative variable
* two quantitative variables
* one quantitative response variable and one categorical explanatory variable

The "golden ticket" shown on the next page presents a visual summary of the similarities and differences across these five scenarios.
