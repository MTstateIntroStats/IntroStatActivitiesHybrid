## Module 1 Review - Sampling Methods

1.	Suppose that the proportion of all American adults that fit the medical definition of being obese is 0.23. A large medical clinic would like to determine if the proportion of their patients that are obese is higher than that of all American adults. The clinic takes a simple random sample of 30 of their patients and finds that 9 patients in the sample are obese.

2.	Martha works in Macy’s advertising department. She is interested in the shopping experience of all Macy’s shoppers in the U.S. Every Saturday morning for a month she stands outside of the Bozeman Macy’s asking people about their experience. One of the questions she uses is: “As a huge fan of Macy’s, I believe Macy’s has the best choices of clothing in Bozeman. Don’t you agree?” Every person that was asked, responded.

3. This study aims to explore whether Swiss university students feeling academic study pressure (whether the student had experienced academic failure) tend to use psychotropic drugs (whether the student had used psychotropic drugs during the student’s time at university) as a coping mechanism. An invitation email was sent to all bachelor’s and master’s students at the University of Lausanne, totaling 15,400 individuals, with a link to access the online questionnaire containing 49 questions and 107 items. No reminder was sent out, and no incentive was given to complete the questionnaire. A total of 1,690 students initially participated in the study, but 424 questionnaires were too incomplete to be used for analysis and were excluded. Additionally, 67 questionnaires were removed because of significant missing sociodemographic information, resulting in 1,199 completed responses included in the final analysis.  Is there an association between study pressure and use of psychotropic drugs among Swiss University students?

4. Researchers decided to investigate whether a cat’s coat color is associated with aggressive cat behavior by creating a 20-minute survey. The survey was distributed by posting it to social media and through cat-related listservs (e.g., For the Love of Cats), inviting individuals to take the survey. A total of 1,365 surveys were completed by participants. The frequency of each of the following aggressive behavior categories was assessed: hiss, stalk/chase, bite, slap/scratch. Frequency of behaviors toward people were recorded on a 6-point scale: 0 = never, 1 = less than once every 6 months, 2 = once every 6 months, 3 = once per month, 4 = once per week, 5 = one or more times per day. Because there were four aggressive behavior categories, each with a frequency of 0 to 5 possible, each cat could score between 0 to 20 for human aggression. Is there an association between coat color and aggressive behavior among cats?
