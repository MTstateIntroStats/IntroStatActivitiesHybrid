## Lecture Notes Week 1: Intro to data

\setstretch{1}

Read through Sections 1.2.1 - 1.2.5 in the course textbook prior to coming to class on Monday using the reading guides at the beginning of week 2 material.

### Data basics: Sections 1.2.1 - 1.2.2

Data:  _______________________________ used to answer research questions

Observational unit or case:  the people or things we _____________________ data from

Variable: what is measured on each __________________________ or
_____________________________________ .

#### Types of variables {-}

* Categorical Variable: 

\vspace{0.5in}

\rgi Ordinal:  levels of the variable have a _________________________ ordering 
    
\rgi \rgi Examples: ‘Scale’ questions, Years of schooling completed

\rgi Nominal:levels of the variable do _______________ have a natural ordering

\rgi \rgi Examples: hair color, eye color, zipcode
    
* Quantitative Variable: 

\vspace{0.5in}

\rgi Continuous variables: value can be any ____________________ within a range.
    
\rgi \rgi Examples: percentage of students who are nursing majors, average hours of exercise per week; distance or time (measured with enough precision)

\rgi Discrete variables: can only be ___________________________ values, with jumps between
    
\rgi \rgi Examples: years of schooling completed; SAT score, number of car accidents
    
Example:  The Bureau of Transportation Statistics collects data on all forms of public transportation. The data set seen here includes several variables collect on flights departing on a random sample of 150 US airports in December of 2019.

#### Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Summary Statistic: a number which _______________________ an entire data set

\rgi Examples: 

\rgi \rgi proportion of people who had a stroke

\vspace{0.3in}
    
\rgi \rgi mean (or average) age
    
\vspace{0.3in}

* Summary statistic and type of plot used depends on the type of variable(s)!  

### Roles of variables: Sections 1.2.3 - 1.2.5

Explanatory variable: predictor variable

* The variable researchers think *may be* ____________________ the other variable.
    
\rgi In an experiment, what the researchers _____________________________ or ______________________.
    
\rgi The groups that we are comparing from the data set.

* Response variable: 

\rgi The variable researchers think *may be* __________________________________________ by the other variable.

\rgi Always simply __________________________ or _____________________________________; never controlled by researchers.

Examples:

Can you predict a criminal’s height based on the footprint left at the scene of a crime?

In the Physician's Health Study, male physicians participated in a study to determine whether taking a daily low-dose aspirin reduced the risk of heart attacks. The male physicians were randomly assigned to the treatment groups. After five years, 104 of the 11,037 male physicians taking a daily low-dose aspirin had experienced a heart attack while 189 of the 11,034 male physicians taking a placebo had experienced a heart attack.
