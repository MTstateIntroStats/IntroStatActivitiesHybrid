# Inference for a Two Categorical Variable: Simulation Methods

## Vocabulary Review and Key Topics

Review the Golden Ticket posted in the resources at the end of the coursepack for a summary of a two categorical variables.

Types of plots for two categorical variables

* **Segmented bar plot**: plots the conditional proportion of the response outcomes in each explanatory variable group

    * The plot shows no association between the variables, if the height of each segment is approximately the same in each group
    
* **Mosaic plot**: similar to the segmented bar plot but the sample size is reflected by the width of the bars

Summary measures

* **Difference in proportion**: calculation of the difference in two conditional proportions 

    * Parameter notation: $\pi_1 - \pi_2$
    
    * Sample notation: $\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2$
    
* **Relative risk**: the ratio of the conditional proportions

    * $\text{Relative Risk} = \frac{\hat{p}_1}{\hat{p}_2}$
    
Interpretation of relative risk:

* The risk of success in group 1 is relative risk times the risk of success in group 2

* Can also interpret as a percent increase or percent decrease in risk

    * $$(RR-1) \times 100\%$$
    
    * The risk of success in group 1 is xx\% higher or lower that the risk of success in group 2
    
* Explanatory variable: the variable researchers think *may be* affecting the other variable.
    
* Response variable: the variable researchers think *may be* influenced by the other variable.

* Confounding variable: 
    - associated with both the explanatory and the response variable
    - explains the association shown by the data 

Study Design

* Observational study: 

* Randomized experiment:

* Conditions necessary to use simulation methods for inference for two categorical variables

    * There must be independence of observational units within groups and between groups
