This coursepack accompanies the textbook for STAT 216: Montana State Introductory Statistics with R, which can be found at \url{https://mtstateintrostats.github.io/IntroStatTextbook/}. The syllabus for the course (including the course calendar), data sets, and links to D2L Brightspace, Gradescope, and the MSU RStudio server can be found on the course webpage: \url{https://math.montana.edu/courses/s216/}.
Other notes and review materials are linked in D2L.

Each of the activities in this workbook is designed to target specific learning outcomes of the course, giving you practice with important statistical concepts in a group setting with instructor guidance. In addition to the in-class activities for the course, video notes are provided to aid in taking notes while you complete the required videos. Bring this workbook with you to class each class period, and take notes in the workbook as you would your own notes. A well-written completed workbook will provide an optimal study guide for exams!

All activities and labs in this coursepack will be completed during class time. Parts of each lab will be turned in on Gradescope. To aid in your understanding, read through the introduction for each activity before attending class each day.

STAT 216 is a 3-credit in-person course. In our experience, it takes six to nine hours per week outside of class to achieve a good grade in this class. By ``good'' we mean at least a C because a grade of D or below does not count toward fulfilling degree requirements. Many of you set your goals higher than just getting a C, and we fully support that. You need roughly nine hours per week to review past activities, read feedback on previous assignments, complete current assignments, and prepare for the next day's class. A typical week in the life of a STAT 216 student looks like:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{Prior to class meeting}:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Read assigned sections of the textbook, using the provided reading guides to take notes on the material.
  \item
    Watch the provided videos, taking notes in the coursepack.
  \item
    Read through the introduction to the day's in-class activity.
  \item
    Read through the week's homework assignment and note any questions you may have on the content.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \emph{During class meeting}:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Work through the guided activity, in-class activity or weekly lab with your classmates and instructor, taking detailed notes on your answers to each question in the activity.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \emph{After class meeting}:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Complete any parts of the activity you did not complete in class.
  \item
    Review the activity solutions in the Math and Stat Center, and take notes on key points.
  \item
    Complete any remaining assigned readings for the week.
  \item
    Complete the week's homework assignment.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Basics of Data and Sampling Methods}\label{basics-of-data-and-sampling-methods}

\section{Vocabulary Review and Key Topics}\label{vocabulary-review-and-key-topics}

At the beginning of each module is a summary of key topics and new vocabulary terms for that module. As you read through the material in the textbook and watch the videos prior to class, look for these terms. Reference the definitions to guide your understanding.

\subsection{Key topics}\label{key-topics}

Module 1 introduces the foundations of data: observational units, types of variables, and how to collect sample data from a population of interest in a way that allows us to generalize our results back to the population.

\subsection{Vocabulary}\label{vocabulary}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Data}: observations used to answer research questions.
\item
  \textbf{Observational units (cases)}: the subjects or entities on which data are collected.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    The rows in a data set represent the observational units.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Sample size}: the number of observational units in a data set, denoted by \(n\).
\item
  \textbf{Variable}: the characteristics collected on each observational unit.
\item
  \textbf{Types of variables}:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    \textbf{Categorical}: cases are grouped into categories.
  \item
    \textbf{Quantitative}: numerical measurements, where performing arithmetic operations makes sense.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Target population}: group of observational units of interest.
\item
  \textbf{Sample}: subset of the population.
\item
  \textbf{Sampling methods}:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    \textbf{Unbiased sampling method (e.g., a random sample)}: on average, the sample will be representative of the target population; all observational units in the target population have the same chance of being selected.
  \item
    \textbf{Biased sampling method (e.g., convenience sample)}: on average, the sample will not be representative of the target population; some part of the target population will be over- or under-represented.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Type of sampling bias}:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    \textbf{Selection bias}: method of sampling is biased; some part of the target population is over- or under-represented.
  \item
    \textbf{Non-response bias}: part of a pre-selected sample does not respond or cannot be reached.
  \item
    \textbf{Response bias}: responses are not truthful (poor/leading question phrasing, social desirability).
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Generalization}: to what group of observational units can the results be applied to?

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    If an unbiased method of selection was used and there is no non-response or response bias, we can generalize the results to the target population.
  \item
    If a biased method of selection was used or if non-response or response bias is present, we can only generalize the result to the sample or similar observational units.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Activity 1: Intro to Data}\label{activity-1-intro-to-data}

\setstretch{1}

\subsection{Learning outcomes}\label{learning-outcomes}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Creating a data set
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Terminology review}\label{terminology-review}

Statistics is the study of how best to collect, analyze, and draw conclusions from data. This week in class you will be introduced to the following terms:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Observational units or cases
\item
  Variables: categorical or quantitative
\end{itemize}

For more on these concepts, read Chapter 1 in the textbook.

\subsection{General information on the Coursepack}\label{general-information-on-the-coursepack}

Information is provided throughout each activity and lab to guide students through that day's activity or lab. Be sure to read ALL the material provided at the beginning of the activity and between each question. At the end of each activity is a section called \emph{Take-home messages} that contains key points from the day's activity. Use these to review the day's activity and make sure you have a full understanding of that material.

\subsection{Steps of the statistical investigation process}\label{steps-of-the-statistical-investigation-process}

As we move through the semester we will work through the six steps of the statistical investigation process.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Ask a research question.
\item
  Design a study and collect data.
\item
  Summarize and visualize the data.
\item
  Use statistical analysis methods to draw inferences from the data.
\item
  Communicate the results and answer the research question.
\item
  Revisit and look forward.
\end{enumerate}

Today we will focus on the first two steps.

\textbf{Step 1}: The first step of any statistical investigation is to \emph{ask a research question}. As stated in the textbook, ``with the rise of data science, however, we might not start with a research question, and instead start with a data set.'' Today we will create a data set by collecting responses on students in class.

\textbf{Step 2}: To answer any research question, we must \emph{design a study and collect data}. Our study will consist of answers from each student. Your responses will become our observed data that we will explore.

\textbf{Observational units} or \textbf{cases} are the subjects data are collected on. In a spreadsheet of the data set, each row will represent a single observational unit.

\newpage

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Open the Google Form linked in D2L and fill in the responses for the following questions. When creating a data set for use in R it is important to use single words or an underscore between words. Each outcome must be written the same way each time. Make sure to use all lowercase letters to create this data set to have consistency between responses. Do not give units of measure for numerical values within the data set. For \texttt{Residency} use in\_state or out\_state as the two outcomes.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Major: what is your declared major?
\end{itemize}

\vspace{0.2in}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Residency: do you have in-state or out-of-state residency?
\end{itemize}

\vspace{0.2in}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Num\_Credits: how many credits are you taking this semester?
\end{itemize}

\vspace{0.2in}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Dominant\_hand: are you left or right-handed?
\end{itemize}

\vspace{0.2in}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Hand\_span: what is the width of your dominant hand from the tip of your thumb to the tip of your pinky with your hand spread out measured in cm?
\end{itemize}

\vspace{0.2in}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Grip\_dominant: what is the grip strength measured in lbs for your dominant hand?
\end{itemize}

\vspace{0.2in}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Grip\_nondominant: what is the grip strength measured in lbs for your non-dominant hand?
\end{itemize}

\vspace{0.2in}

\subsection{Take-home messages}\label{take-home-messages}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  When creating a data set, each row will represent a single observational unit or case. Each column represents a variable collected. It is important to write each variable as a single word or use an underscore between words.
\item
  Make sure to be consistent with writing each outcome in the data set as R is case sensitive. All outcomes must be written exactly the same way.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Additional notes}\label{additional-notes}

Use this space to summarize your thoughts and take additional notes on today's activity and material covered, and to write down the names and contact information of your teammates.

\vspace{0.5in}

Example of Selection Bias: Newspaper article from 1936 reported that Landon won the presidential election over Roosevelt based on a poll of 10 million voters. Roosevelt was the actual winner. What was wrong with this poll? Poll was completed using a telephone survey and not all people in 1936 had a telephone. Only a certain subset of the population owned a telephone so this subset was over-represented in the telephone survey. The results of the study, showing that Landon would win, did not represent the target population of all US voters.

\begin{itemize}

\item
  Non-response bias:
\end{itemize}

\vspace{0.5in}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  To calculate the non-response rate:
\end{itemize}

\[\frac{\text{number of people who do not respond}}{\text{total number of people selected for the sample}}\times 100\%\]

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  For non-response bias to occur must first select people to participate and then they choose not to.
\end{itemize}

Example of Non-response bias: A company randomly selects buyers to complete a review of an online purchase but some choose not to respond.

\subsection{American Indian Address}\label{american-indian-address}

For this activity, you will read a speech given by Jim Becenti, a member of the Navajo American Indian tribe, who spoke about the employment problems his people faced at an Office of Indian Affairs meeting in Phoenix, Arizona, on January 30, 1947 (Moquin and Van Doren 1973). His speech is below:

\textbf{It is hard for us to go outside the reservation where we meet strangers. I have been off the reservation ever since I was sixteen. Today I am sorry I quit the Santa Fe {[}Railroad{]}. I worked for them in 1912--13. You are enjoying life, liberty, and happiness on the soil the American Indian had, so it is your responsibility to give us a hand, brother. Take us out of distress. I have never been to vocational school. I have very little education. I look at the white man who is a skilled laborer. When I was a young man I worked for a man in Gallup as a carpenter's helper. He treated me as his own brother. I used his tools. Then he took his tools and gave me a list of tools I should buy and I started carpentering just from what I had seen. We have no alphabetical language.}

\textbf{We see things with our eyes and can always remember it. I urge that we help my people to progress in skilled labor as well as common labor. The hope of my people is to change our ways and means in certain directions, so they can help you someday as taxpayers. If not, as you are going now, you will be burdened the rest of your life. The hope of my people is that you will continue to help so that we will be all over the United States and have a hand with you, and give us a brotherly hand so we will be happy as you are. Our reservation is awful small. We did not know the capacity of the range until the white man come and say ``you raise too much sheep, got to go somewhere else,'' resulting in reduction to a skeleton where the Indians can't make a living on it. For eighty years we have been confused by the general public, and what is the condition of the Navajo today? Starvation! We are starving for education. Education is the main thing and the only thing that is going to make us able to compete with you great men here talking to us.}

\subsubsection*{Random selection}\label{random-selection}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Random selection}

Suppose instead of attempting to select a representative sample by eye (which did not work), each student used a random number generator to select a simple random sample of 10 words. A \textbf{simple random sample} relies on a random mechanism to choose a sample, without replacement, from the population, such that every sample of size 10 is equally likely to be chosen.

To use a random number generator to select a simple random sample, you first need a numbered list of all the words in the population, called a \textbf{sampling frame}. You can then generate 10 random numbers from the numbers 1 to 359 (the number of words in the population), and the chosen random numbers correspond to the chosen words in your sample.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{9}
\tightlist
\item
  Use the random number generator at \url{https://istats.shinyapps.io/RandomNumbers/} to select a simple random sample from the population of all 359 words in the speech.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Set ``Choose Minimum'' to 1 and ``Choose Maximum'' to 359 to represent the 359 words in the population (the sampling frame).
\item
  Set ``How many numbers do you want to generate?'' to 10 and ensure the ``No'' option is selected under ``Sample with Replacement?''
\item
  Click ``Generate''.
\end{itemize}

\item
  When we use a biased method of selection, we will over or underestimate the parameter.
\item
  If the sampling method is biased, inferences made about the population based on a sample estimate will not be valid.
\item
  Random selection is an unbiased method of selection.
\item
  To determine if a sampling method is biased or unbiased, we compare the distribution of the estimates to the true value. We want our estimate to be on target or unbiased. When using unbiased methods of selection, the mean of the distribution matches or is very similar to our true parameter.
\item
  Random selection eliminates selection bias. However, random selection will not eliminate response or non-response bias.
\item
  The larger the sample size, the more similar (less variable) the statistics will be from different samples.
\item
  Sample size has no impact on whether a \emph{sampling method} is biased or not. Taking a larger sample using a biased method will still result in a sample that is not representative of the population.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Proportions
\item
  Probability
\item
  Conditional probability
\item
  Two-way tables
\end{itemize}

To review these concepts, see Chapter 23 in the textbook.

\subsection{Overview of probabiliy}\label{overview-of-probabiliy}

The probability of an event is the long-run proportion of times the event would occur if the random process were repeated indefinitely (under identical conditions).

To calculate the probability of an event happening:

\[\text{probability} = \frac{\text{number of ways an event can happen}}{\text{total number of possible outcomes}}\]

For example, to calculate the probability of a coin flip landing on heads; there are only two outcomes (heads or tails) and only one possibility way to land on heads.

\[P(heads) = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5\]
The figure below shows the long-run proportion of times a simulated coin flip lands on heads on the y-axis, and the number of tosses on the x-axis. Notice how the long-run proportion starts converging to 0.5 as the number of tosses increases.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.65\linewidth]{images/coinsim} 

}

\end{figure}

In today's activity we will discuss the probability of a single event, the probability of an ``and'' event, and the probability of a conditional event.

\subsubsection*{Probability notation}\label{probability-notation}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Probability notation}

We will use the notation P(event) to represent the probability of an event and use letters to represent events. The following are notations for different probabilities where we are discussing event A and event B:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \(P(A)\) represents the probability of event A
\item
  \(P(A^C)\) represents the probability of the complement of event A

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \(P(A^C) = 1 - P(A)\)
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \(P(A and B)\) represents the probability of events A and B
\item
  \(P(A|B)\) represents the probability of event A given event B
\item
  \(P(B|A)\) represents the probability of event B given event A
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Probability questions}\label{probability-questions}

For the beginning of this activity we will start with discussing the probabilities associated with drawing a card from a standard card deck. In a card deck there are:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  52 cards
\item
  Half are red, half are black
\item
  Four suits: spades, hearts, diamonds, and clubs
\item
  Each suit has 13 cards: cards 2\$-\$10, ace, jack, queen, and king
\item
  Let A represent the event that a card is an ace
\item
  Let B represent the event that a card is red
\end{itemize}

To find the probability of selecting an ace, first start with determining how many aces are possible (four) and how many cards will we select from (total of 52).

\vspace{1in}

Find the probability of selecting a card that is not an ace. This is the complement of event A.

\vspace{1in}

Find the probability of selecting a red ace. There are only two red aces and a total of 52 cards.

\vspace{1in}

Find the probability of selecting an ace given that the card is red. There are two red aces but only \(\frac{52}{2} = 26\) red cards

\vspace{1in}

If a card drawn is an ace, what is the probability the card drawn is red. There are four aces but only two that are red.

  A dataset was collected on all NBA basketball players from inception of the league. The probability that an NBA player is above average height is 59.7\%. Of NBA players that are above average height, 46.4\% averaged at least four rebounds a game. The probability that an NBA player averages less than four rebounds in a game given they are below average height is 13.3\%.

  Since the early 1980s, the rapid antigen detection test (RADT) of group A \emph{streptococci} has been used to detect strep throat. A recent study of the accuracy of this test shows that the \textbf{sensitivity}, the probability of a positive RADT given the person has strep throat, is 86\% in children, while the \textbf{specificity}, the probability of a negative RADT given the person does not have strep throat, is 92\% in children. The \textbf{prevalence}, the probability of having group A strep, is 37\% in children. (Stewart et al. 2014)

\subsection{Take home messages}\label{take-home-messages-4}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Conditional probabilities are calculated dependent on a second variable. In probability notation, the variable following \texttt{\textbar{}} is the variable on which we are conditioning. The denominator used to calculate the probability will be the total for the variable on which we are conditioning.
\item
  When creating a two-way table we typically want to put the explanatory variable on the columns of the table and the response variable on the rows.
\item
  To fill in the two-way table, always start with the unconditional variable in the total row or column and then use the conditional probabilities to fill in the interior cells.

\section{Vocabulary Review and Key Topics}\label{vocabulary-review-and-key-topics-2}

Review the Golden Ticket posted in the resources at the end of the coursepack for a summary of a single categorical variable.

\subsection{Key topics}\label{key-topics-2}

Module 3 introduces the steps of the statistical investigation process. We explore exploratory data analysis (summary statistics and plots) and simulation-based inference (hypothesis testing and confidence intervals) in the single categorical variable (one proportion) scenario.

\subsubsection*{Steps of the statistical investigation process}\label{steps-of-the-statistical-investigation-process-1}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Steps of the statistical investigation process}

As we move through the semester we will work through the six steps of the statistical investigation process.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Ask a research question.
\item
  Design a study and collect data.
\item
  Summarize and visualize the data.
\item
  Use statistical analysis methods to draw inferences from the data.
\item
  Communicate the results and answer the research question.
\item
  Revisit and look forward.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Exploratory data analysis}\label{exploratory-data-analysis}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Exploratory data analysis}

At the end of this module, you should understand how to calculate a summary statistic and plot a single categorical variable.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Notation for a sample proportion: \(\hat{p}\)
\item
  Notation for a population proportion: \(\pi\)
\item
  Types of plots for a single categorical variable:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Frequency bar plot
  \item
    Relative frequency bar plot
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Inference}\label{inference}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Inference}

We will use simulation-based methods \textbf{to find evidence of an effect by finding a p-value} and \textbf{estimating how large the effect is by creating a confidence interval} in the one proportion (one categorical variable) scenario.

These are steps 4 and 5 from the steps of the statistical investigation process.

\subsection{Vocabulary}\label{vocabulary-2}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Summary statistic (point estimate)}: the value of a numerical summary measure computed from \emph{sample} data.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Summary measures covered in STAT 216 include: single proportion, difference in proportions, single mean, paired mean difference, difference in means, correlation, and slope of a regression line.
  \item
    For a single categorical variable, a proportion is calculated.
  \item
    To interpret in context include:

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      Summary measure (in context)
    \item
      Value of the statistic
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Parameter of interest}: a numerical summary measure of the entire \emph{population} in which we are interested.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    The value of the parameter of interest is unknown (unless we have access to the entire population).
  \item
    To write in context:

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      Population word (true, long-run, population)
    \item
      Summary measure (depends on the type of data)
    \item

\subsubsection*{Inference}\label{inference-1}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Inference}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Hypothesis testing}: a formal statistical technique for evaluating two competing possibilities about a population: the null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    When we observe an effect in a sample, we would like to determine if this observed effect represents an actual effect in the population, or whether it was simply due to random chance.
  \item
    A hypothesis test helps us answer the following question about the population: How strong is the \emph{evidence} of an effect?
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Null hypothesis}: typically represents a statement of ``no difference'', ``no effect'', or the status quo.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    The null hypothesis is what we assume is true when calculating the p-value. Thus, we can never have evidence \emph{for} the null hypothesis---we cannot ``accept'' a null hypothesis---we can only find evidence \emph{against} the null hypothesis if the observed data is very unlikely to have occurred under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Alternative hypothesis}: represents an alternative claim under consideration and is often represented by a range of possible values for the parameter of interest.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    The alternative hypothesis is determined by the research question.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Hypotheses in notation for a single proportion}: In the hypotheses below, \(\pi_0\) is the \textbf{null value}.
\end{itemize}

\[H_0: \pi = \pi_0\]
\[H_A: \pi \left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
< \\
\ne \\
< \\
\end{array}
\right\}
\pi_0 \]

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Null distribution}: a distribution of simulated sample statistics created under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true
\item
  \textbf{Simulation methods to create the null distribution}: a process of using a computer program (e.g., R) to simulate many samples that we would expect based on the null hypothesis.

  R code to use simulation methods for one categorical variable to find the p-value, \texttt{one\_proportion\_test}, is shown below.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{one\_proportion\_test}\NormalTok{(}\AttributeTok{probability\_success =}\NormalTok{ xx, }\CommentTok{\# Null hypothesis value}
      \AttributeTok{sample\_size =}\NormalTok{ xx, }\CommentTok{\# Enter sample size}
      \AttributeTok{number\_repetitions =} \DecValTok{1000}\NormalTok{, }\CommentTok{\# Enter number of simulations}
      \AttributeTok{as\_extreme\_as =}\NormalTok{ xx, }\CommentTok{\# Observed statistic}
      \AttributeTok{direction =} \StringTok{"xx"}\NormalTok{, }\CommentTok{\# Specify direction of alternative hypothesis}
      \AttributeTok{summary\_measure =} \StringTok{"proportion"}\NormalTok{) }\CommentTok{\# Reporting proportion or number of successes?}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}
\item
  \textbf{P-value}: the probability of the value of the observed sample statistic or a value more extreme, if the null hypothesis were true.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    To write in context include:

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      Statement about probability or proportion of samples
    \item
      Statistic (summary measure and value)
    \item
      Direction of the alternative
    \item
      Null hypothesis (in context)
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Strength of evidence}: the p-value indicates the amount of evidence there is against the null hypothesis. The smaller the p-value the more evidence there is against the null hypothesis.
\end{itemize}

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{images/soe_gradient_gray} \end{center}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Conclusion} (to a hypothesis test): answers the research question. How much evidence is there in support of the alternative hypothesis?

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    To write in context include:

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      Amount of evidence
    \item
      Parameter of interest
    \item
      Direction of the alternative hypothesis
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Confidence interval}: an interval estimate for the parameter of interest.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    A confidence interval helps us answer the following question about the population: How \emph{large} is the effect?
  \item
    To write in context include:

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      How confident you are (e.g., 90\%, 95\%, 98\%, 99\%)
    \item
      Parameter of interest
    \item
      Calculated interval
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Bootstrapping}: creating a simulated sample of the same size as the original sample by sampling with replacement from the original sample.
\item
  \textbf{Simulation methods to create the bootstrap distribution}: a process of using a computer program to simulate many bootstrapped samples.

  R code to use simulation methods for one categorical variable to find a confidence interval, \texttt{one\_proportion\_bootstrap\_CI}, is shown below.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{one\_proportion\_bootstrap\_CI}\NormalTok{(}\AttributeTok{sample\_size =}\NormalTok{ xx, }\CommentTok{\# Sample size}
                \AttributeTok{number\_successes =}\NormalTok{ xx, }\CommentTok{\# Observed number of successes}
                \AttributeTok{number\_repetitions =} \DecValTok{1000}\NormalTok{, }\CommentTok{\# Number of bootstrap samples to use}
                \AttributeTok{confidence\_level =} \FloatTok{0.95}\NormalTok{) }\CommentTok{\# Confidence level as a decimal}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}
\item
  \textbf{Percentile method}: process to find the confidence interval from the bootstrap distribution.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    A 90\% confidence interval will be found between the 5th and 95th percentiles of the bootstrap distribution.
  \item
    A 95\% confidence interval will be found between the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of the bootstrap distribution.
  \item
    A 99\% confidence interval will be found between the 0.5th and 99.5th percentiles of the bootstrap distribution.

Example from the Video: Gallatin Valley is the fastest growing county in Montana. You'll often hear Bozeman residents complaining about the `out-of-staters' moving in. A local real estate agent recorded data on a random sample of 100 home sales over the last year at her company and noted where the buyers were moving from as well as the age of the person or average age of a couple buying a home. The variable age was binned into two categories, ``Under30'' and ``Over30.'' Additionally, the variable, state the buyers were moving from, was created as a binary variable, ``Out'' for a location out of state and ``In'' for a location in state.

The following code reads in the data set, \texttt{moving\_to\_mt} and names the object moving.

We will work through a five-step process to complete a hypothesis test for a single proportion, first introduced in the activity in week 1.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Ask a research question} that can be addressed by collecting data. What are the researchers trying to show?
\item
  \textbf{Design a study and collect data}. This step involves selecting the people or objects to be studied and how to gather relevant data on them.
\item
  \textbf{Summarize and visualize the data}. Calculate summary statistics and create graphical plots that best represent the research question.
\item
  \textbf{Use statistical analysis methods to draw inferences from the data}. Choose a statistical inference method appropriate for the data and identify the p-value and/or confidence interval after checking assumptions. In this study, we will focus on using randomization to generate a simulated p-value.
\item
  \textbf{Communicate the results and answer the research question}. Using the p-value and confidence interval from the analysis, determine whether the data provide statistical evidence against the null hypothesis. Write a conclusion that addresses the research question.

\subsection{Helper-Hinderer}\label{helper-hinderer}

A study by Hamblin, Wynn, and Bloom reported in Nature (Hamblin, Wynn, and Bloom 2007) was intended to check young kids' feelings about helpful and non-helpful behavior. Non-verbal infants ages 6 to 10 months were shown short videos with different shapes either helping or hindering the climber. As a class we will watch this short video to see how the experiment was run: \url{https://youtu.be/anCaGBsBOxM}. Researchers were hoping to assess: Are infants more likely to choose the helper toy over the hinderer toy? In the study, of the 16 infants age 6 to 10 months, 14 chose the \emph{helper} toy and 2 chose the \emph{hinderer} toy.

In this study, the \textbf{observational units are the infants ages 6 to 10 months}. The \textbf{variable measured on each observational unit (infant) is whether they chose the helper or the hinderer toy}. This is a categorical variable so we will be assessing the proportion of infants ages 6 to 10 months that choose the helper toy. Choosing the helper toy in this study will be considered a success.

For almost all activities and labs it will be necessary to upload the provided R script file from D2L for that day. Your instructor will highlight a few steps in uploading files to and using RStudio.

The following are the steps to upload the necessary R script file for this activity:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Download the Activity R script file from D2L.
\item
  Click ``Upload'' in the ``Files'' tab in the bottom right window of RStudio. In the pop-up window, click ``Choose File'', and navigate to the folder where the Activity R script file is saved (most likely in your downloads folder). Click ``Open''; then click ``Ok''.
\item
  You should see the uploaded file appear in the list of files in the bottom right window. Click on the file name to open the file in the Editor window (upper left window).
\end{itemize}

Notice that the first threelines of code contain a prompt called \texttt{library}. Packages needed to run functions in R are stored in directories called libraries. When using the MSU RStudio server, all the packages needed for the class are already installed. We simply must tell R which packages we need for each R script file. We use the prompt \texttt{library} to load each \textbf{package} (or library) needed for each activity. Note, these \texttt{library} lines MUST be run each time you open a R script file in order for the functions in R to work.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Highlight and run lines 1--3 to load the packages needed for this activity. Notice the use of the \# symbol in the R script file. This symbol is not part of the R code. It is used by these authors to add comments to the R code and explain what each call is telling the program to do.
\end{itemize}

R will ignore everything after a \# symbol when executing the code. Refer to the instructions following the \# symbol to understand what you need to enter in the code.

We could also choose to display the data as a proportion in a \textbf{relative frequency} bar plot. To find the relative frequency, the count in each level of \texttt{choice} is divided by the sample size. This calculation is the sample proportion for each level of choice.

We cannot assess whether infants are more likely to choose the helper toy based on the statistic and plot alone. The next step is to analyze the data by using a hypothesis test to discover if there is evidence against the null hypothesis.

\subsubsection*{Use statistical analysis methods to draw inferences from the data}\label{use-statistical-analysis-methods-to-draw-inferences-from-the-data}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Use statistical analysis methods to draw inferences from the data}

When performing a hypothesis test, we must first identify the null hypothesis. The null hypothesis is written about the parameter of interest, or the value that summarizes the variable in the population.

The parameter of interest is a statement about what we want to find about the population. The following must be included when writing the parameter of interest.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Population word (true, long-run, population)
\item
  Summary measure (depends on the type of data)
\item
  Context

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Observational units
  \item
    Variable(s)
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

For this study, the parameter of interest, \(\pi\), represents the \textbf{true or population proportion of infants ages 6--10 months who will choose the helper toy}.

If the children are just randomly choosing the toy, we would expect half (0.5) of the infants to choose the helper toy. This is the null value for our study.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{5}
\tightlist
\item
  Using the parameter of interest given above, write out the null hypothesis in words. That is, what do we assume to be true about the parameter of interest when we perform our simulation?
  \vspace{0.8in}
\end{enumerate}

The notation used for a population proportion (or probability, or true proportion) is \(\pi\). Since this summarizes a population, it is a parameter. When writing the \textbf{null hypothesis} in notation, we set the parameter equal to the null value, \(H_0: \pi = \pi_0\).

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{6}
\tightlist
\item
  Write the null hypothesis in notation using the null value of 0.5 in place of \(\pi_0\) in the equation given on the previous page.
\end{enumerate}

\vspace{0.5in}

The \textbf{alternative hypothesis} is the claim to be tested and the direction of the claim (less than, greater than, or not equal to) is based on the research question.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{7}
\tightlist
\item
  Based on the research question from question 1, are we testing that the parameter is greater than 0.5, less than 0.5 or different than 0.5?
\end{enumerate}

\vspace{0.2in}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{8}
\tightlist
\item
  Write out the alternative hypothesis in notation.
\end{enumerate}

\vspace{0.5in}

Remember that when utilizing a hypothesis test, we are evaluating two competing possibilities. For this study the \textbf{two possibilities} are either\ldots{}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The true proportion of infants who choose the helper is 0.5 and our results just occurred by random chance; or,
\item
  The true proportion of infants who choose the helper is greater than 0.5 and our results reflect this.
\end{itemize}

Notice that these two competing possibilities represent the null and alternative hypotheses.

We will now simulate one sample of a \textbf{null distribution} of sample proportions. The null distribution is created under the assumption the null hypothesis is true. In this case, we assume the true proportion of infants who choose the helper is 0.5, so we will create 1000 (or more) different simulations of 16 infants under this assumption.

Let's think about how to use a coin to create one simulation of 16 infants under the assumption the null hypothesis is true. Let heads equal infant chose the helper toy and tails equal infant chose the hinderer toy.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{9}

  How many times would you flip a coin to simulate the sample of infants?
\end{enumerate}

\setcounter{enumi}{10}
\tightlist
\item
  Flip a coin 16 times recording the number of times the coin lands on heads. This represents one simulated sample of 16 infants randomly choosing the toy. Calculate the proportion of coin flips that resulted in heads.
\end{enumerate}

\vspace{0.2in}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{11}

\item
  Is the value from question 9 closer to 0.5, the null value, or closer to the sample proportion, 0.875?
\end{enumerate}

\vspace{0.2in}

Report the number of coin flips you got in the Google sheet on D2L.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}

\item
  Sketch the graph created by your instructor of the proportion of heads out of 16 coin flips.
\end{enumerate}

\vspace{2in}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{13}
\tightlist
\item
  Circle the observed statistic (value from question 3) on the distribution shown above. Where does this statistic fall in this distribution: Is it near the center of the distribution (near 0.5) or in one of the tails of the distribution?
\end{enumerate}

\vspace{0.2in}

\begin{enumerate}

\setcounter{enumi}{14}

\item
  Is the observed statistic likely to happen or unlikely to happen if the true proportion of infants who choose the helper is 0.5? Explain your answer using the plot.
\end{enumerate}

\vspace{0.8in}

In the next class, we will continue to assess the strength of evidence against the null hypothesis by using a computer to simulate 1000 samples when we assume the null hypothesis is true.

\subsection{Take-home messages}\label{take-home-messages-5}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Two types of plots are used for plotting categorical variables: frequency bar plots, relative frequency bar plots.
\item
  In a hypothesis test we have two competing hypotheses, the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis. The null hypothesis represents either a skeptical perspective or a perspective of no difference or no effect. The alternative hypothesis represents a new perspective such as the possibility that there has been a change or that there is a treatment effect in an experiment.
\item
  In a simulation-based test, we create a distribution of possible simulated statistics for our sample if the null hypothesis is true. Then we see if the calculated observed statistic from the data is likely or unlikely to occur when compared to the null distribution.
\item
  To create one simulated sample on the null distribution for a sample proportion, spin a spinner with probability equal to \(\pi_0\) (the null value), \(n\) times or draw with replacement \(n\) times from a deck of cards created to reflect \(\pi_0\) as the probability of success. Calculate and plot the proportion of successes from the simulated sample.

In today's activity we will continue with steps 4 and 5 in the statistical investigation process. We will continue to assess the Helper-Hinderer study from last class.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Ask a research question} that can be addressed by collecting data. What are the researchers trying to show?
\item
  \textbf{Design a study and collect data}. This step involves selecting the people or objects to be studied and how to gather relevant data on them.
\item
  \textbf{Summarize and visualize the data}. Calculate summary statistics and create graphical plots that best represent the research question.
\item
  \textbf{Use statistical analysis methods to draw inferences from the data}. Choose a statistical inference method appropriate for the data and identify the p-value and/or confidence interval after checking assumptions. In this study, we will focus on using randomization to generate a simulated p-value.
\item
  \textbf{Communicate the results and answer the research question}. Using the p-value and confidence interval from the analysis, determine whether the data provide statistical evidence against the null hypothesis. Write a conclusion that addresses the research question.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Helper-Hinderer}\label{helper-hinderer-1}

A study by Hamblin, Wynn, and Bloom reported in Nature (Hamblin, Wynn, and Bloom 2007) was intended to check young kids' feelings about helpful and non-helpful behavior. Non-verbal infants ages 6 to 10 months were shown short videos with different shapes either helping or hindering the climber. As a class we will watch this short video to see how the experiment was run: \url{https://youtu.be/anCaGBsBOxM}. Researchers were hoping to assess: Are infants more likely to choose the helper toy over the hinderer toy? In the study, of the 16 infants age 6 to 10 months, 14 chose the \emph{helper} toy and 2 chose the \emph{hinderer} toy.

Today, we will use the computer to simulate a null distribution of 1000 different samples of 16 infants, plotting the proportion who chose the helper in each sample, based on the assumption that the true proportion of infants who choose the helper is 0.5 (or that the null hypothesis is true).

\subsection{Helper-Hinderer}\label{helper-hinderer-2}

In the last class, we found very strong evidence that the true proportion of infants who will choose the helper character is greater than 0.5. But what \emph{is} the true proportion of infants who will choose the helper character? We will use this same study to estimate this parameter of interest by creating a confidence interval.

As a reminder: A study by Hamblin, Wynn, and Bloom reported in Nature (Hamblin, Wynn, and Bloom 2007) was intended to check young kids' feelings about helpful and non-helpful behavior. Non-verbal infants ages 6 to 10 months were shown short videos with different shapes either helping or hindering the climber. Researchers were hoping to assess: Are infants more likely to preferentially choose the helper toy over the hinderer toy? In the study, of the 16 infants age 6 to 10 months, 14 chose the \emph{helper} toy and 2 chose the \emph{hinderer} toy.

A \textbf{point estimate} (our observed statistic) provides a single plausible value for a parameter. However, a point estimate is rarely perfect; usually there is some error in the estimate. In addition to supplying a point estimate of a parameter, a next logical step would be to provide a plausible \emph{range} of values for the parameter. This plausible range of values for the population parameter is called an \textbf{interval estimate} or \textbf{confidence interval}.

Researchers were interested if infants observe social cues and would be more likely to choose the helper toy over the hinderer toy. In a sample of (sample size) \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_infants, (number of successes) \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_chose the helper toy. A simulation null distribution with 1000 simulations was created in RStudio. The p-value was found by calculating the proportion of simulations in the null distribution at the sample statistic of 0.875 and greater. This resulted in a p-value of (value of p-value)\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. We would observe a sample proportion of (value of the sample proportion) \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ or (greater, less, more extreme) \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ with a probability of (value of p-value)\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\\
IF we assume (\(H_0\) in context) \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.
Based on this p-value, there is (very strong/little to no) \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ evidence that the (sample/true)\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ proportion of infants age 6 to 10 months who will choose the helper toy is (greater than, less than, not equal to) \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 0.5. In addition, a 95\% confidence interval was found for the parameter of interest. We are 95\% confident that the (true/sample)\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ proportion of infants age 6 to 10 months who will choose the helper toy is between (lower value)\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ and (upper value)\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

\subsection{Take-home messages}\label{take-home-messages-7}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  The goal in a hypothesis test is to assess the strength of evidence for an effect, while the goal in creating a confidence interval is to determine how large the effect is. A \textbf{confidence interval} is a range of \emph{plausible} values for the parameter of interest.
\item
  A confidence interval is built around the point estimate or observed calculated statistic from the sample. This means that the sample statistic is always the center of the confidence interval. A confidence interval includes a measure of sample to sample variability represented by the \textbf{margin of error}.
\item
  In simulation-based methods (bootstrapping), a simulated distribution of possible sample statistics is created showing the possible sample-to-sample variability. Then we find the middle \(X\) percent of the distribution around the sample statistic using the percentile method to give the range of values for the confidence interval. This shows us that we are \(X\)\% confident that the parameter is within this range, where \(X\) represents the level of confidence.
\item
  When the null value is within the confidence interval, it is a plausible value for the parameter of interest; thus, we would find a larger p-value for a hypothesis test of that null value. Conversely, if the null value is NOT within the confidence interval, we would find a small p-value for the hypothesis test and strong evidence against this null hypothesis.
\item
  To create one simulated sample on the bootstrap distribution for a sample proportion, label \(n\) cards with the original responses. Draw with replacement \(n\) times. Calculate and plot the resampled proportion of successes.

\chapter{Inference for a Single Categorical Variable: Theory-based Methods}\label{inference-for-a-single-categorical-variable-theory-based-methods}

\section{Vocabulary Review and Key Topics}\label{vocabulary-review-and-key-topics-3}

Review the Golden Ticket posted in the resources at the end of the coursepack for a summary of a single categorical variable.

\subsection{Key topics}\label{key-topics-3}

Module 3 introduces theory-based inference methods (hypothesis testing and confidence intervals) for a single categorical variable. We also explore what ``confidence level'' means and which parts of a study impact the width of a confidence interval and the p-value.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Theory-based methods should give the same results as simulation-based methods if the sample size is large enough. For a single categorical variable, the sample size is large enough if the success-failure condition is met.
\item
  If repeated samples of the same size are taken from the population, 95\% of samples will create a 95\% confidence interval that contains the value of the parameter of interest.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Vocabulary}\label{vocabulary-3}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Theory-based methods}: when specific conditions are met, the distribution of sample statistics if we were to repeatedly sample from the population can be fit with a theoretical distribution.
\item
  \textbf{Conditions for the sampling distribution of \(\hat{p}\) to follow an approximate normal distribution}:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    \textbf{Independence}: The sample's observations are independent, e.g., are from a simple random sample. (\emph{Remember}: This also must be true to use simulation-based methods!)
  \item
    \textbf{Success-failure condition}: We \emph{expect} to see at least 10 successes and 10 failures in the sample, \(n\pi\geq10\) and \(n(1-\pi)\geq10\). Since \(\pi\) is typically unknown, we consider this condition to be met if we observe at least 10 successes and 10 failures in our data set: \(n\hat{p}\geq10\) and \(n(1-\hat{p})\geq10\).
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Standardized statistic}: calculation to standardize the sample statistic in order to compare the standardized value to the theoretical distribution.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Measures the number of standard errors the sample statistic is above (if positive) or below (if negative) the null value.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Standard normal distribution}: a theoretical distribution that is bell-shaped, centered on the mean of zero, and has a standard deviation of one, denoted in notation by \(N(0,1)\).
\item
  \textbf{Standard error of the sample proportion assuming the null is true}: measures the how far each possible sample proportion is from the true proportion, on average, and is calculated using the null value:
\end{itemize}

\[SE_0(\hat{p})=\sqrt{\frac{\pi_0\times(1-\pi_0)}{n}}\].

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Standardized sample proportion}: standardized statistic for a single categorical variable calculated using:
  \[
  Z = \frac{\hat{p} - \pi_0}{SE_0(\hat{p})},
  \]
  If the conditions for the sampling distribution of \(\hat{p}\) to follow an approximate normal distribution are met, and if the true value of \(\pi\) is equal to the null value of \(\pi_0\), the standardized sample proportion, \(Z\), will have an approximate \emph{standard} normal distribution.
\item
  The p-value can be found by using the \texttt{pnorm} function.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Enter the value of the standardized statistic for \texttt{xx}
  \end{itemize}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{pnorm}\NormalTok{(xx, }\AttributeTok{lower.tail=}\ConstantTok{TRUE}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}
\item
  \textbf{Margin of error}: half the width of the confidence interval. For a single proportion, the margin of error is:
\end{itemize}

\[ME = z^* \times SE(\hat{p})\]
where \(z^*\) is the \textbf{multiplier}, corresponding to the desired confidence level found from the standard normal distribution. For example, for a 95\% confidence level, the middle 95\% of the standard normal distribution falls between \(-z^*=-1.96\) and \(z^*=1.96\).

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Standard error of the sample proportion for a confidence interval}:
  \[SE(\hat{p}) = \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}\times (1-\hat{p})}{n}}\]
\item
  To find the endpoints of a confidence interval, add and subtract the margin of error to the sample statistic:
\end{itemize}

\[\hat{p} \pm ME\]

\begin{itemize}
\item
  R code to find the multiplier for the confidence interval using theory-based methods.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    \texttt{qnorm} will give you the multiplier using the standard normal distribution.
  \item
    Enter the percentile for the given level of confidence (e.g., 0.975 for a 95\% confidence level).

\subsection{Handedness of male boxers}\label{handedness-of-male-boxers}

Left-handedness is a trait that is found in about 10\% of the general population. Past studies have shown that left-handed men are over-represented among professional boxers (Richardson and Gilman 2019). The fighting claim states that left-handed men have an advantage in competition. In this random sample of 500 male professional boxers, we want to see if there is an over-prevalence of left-handed fighters. In the sample of 500 male boxers, 81 were left-handed.

\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Theory-based methods}

The sampling distribution of a single proportion --- how that proportion varies from sample to sample --- can be mathematically modeled using the normal distribution if certain conditions are met.

Conditions for the sampling distribution of \(\hat{p}\) to follow an approximate normal distribution:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Independence}: The sample's observations are independent, e.g., are from a simple random sample. (\emph{Remember}: This also must be true to use simulation methods!)
\item
  \textbf{Success-failure condition}: We \emph{expect} to see at least 10 successes and 10 failures in the sample, \(n\hat{p}≥10\) and \(n(1-\hat{p})≥10\).
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{5}
\tightlist
\item
  Verify that the independence condition is satisfied.
\end{enumerate}

\item
  Is the success-failure condition met to model the data with the normal distribution? Explain your answer in context of the problem.
\end{enumerate}

\vspace{0.8in}

To calculate the standardized statistic we use the general formula

\[
Z = \frac{\text{point estimate} - \text{null value}}{SE_0(\text{point estimate})}.
\]
For a single categorical variable the standardized sample proportion is calculated using

\[
Z = \frac{\hat{p} - \pi_0}{SE_0(\hat{p})},
\]
where the standard error is calculated using the null value:

\[SE_0(\hat{p})=\sqrt{\frac{\pi_0\times(1-\pi_0)}{n}}\].

For this study, the null standard error of the sample proportion is calculated using the null value, 0.1.

\[SE_0(\hat{p})=\sqrt{\frac{0.1\times(1-0.1)}{500}} = 0.013\].

Each sample proportion of male boxers that are left-handed is 0.013 from the true proportion of male boxers that are left-handed, on average.

\item
  Both simulation and theory-based methods can be used to find a p-value for a hypothesis test. In order to use theory-based methods we need to check that both the independence and the success-failure conditions are met.
\item
  The standardized statistic measures how many standard errors the statistic is from the null value. The larger the standardized statistic the more evidence there is against the null hypothesis.
\item
  The p-value for a two-sided test is approximately two times the value for a one-sided test. A two-sided test provides less evidence against the null hypothesis.
\item
  The larger the sample size, the smaller the sample to sample variability. This will result in a larger standardized statistic and more evidence against the null hypothesis.
\item
  The farther the statistic is from the null value, the larger the standardized statistic. This will result in a smaller p-value and more evidence against the null hypothesis.

We will use the male boxer study to look at what confidence means.

Left-handedness is a trait that is found in about 10\% of the general population. Past studies have shown that left-handed men are over-represented among professional boxers (Richardson and Gilman 2019). The fighting claim states that left-handed men have an advantage in competition. In this random sample of 500 male professional boxers, we want to see if there is an over-prevalence of left-handed fighters. In the sample of 500 male boxers, 81 were left-handed.

\[SE(\hat{p}) = \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}\times (1-\hat{p})}{n}}\]

  Calculate the standard error of the sample proportion to find a 95\% confidence interval.
\end{enumerate}

\vspace{0.5in}

We will calculate the margin of error and confidence interval in questions 10 and 11 of this activity. \textbf{The margin of error (ME)} is the value of the \(z^*\) multiplier times the standard error of the statistic.

\[ME = z^* \times SE(\hat{p})\]
The \(z^*\) multiplier is the percentile of a standard normal distribution that corresponds to our confidence level. If our confidence level is 95\%, we find the Z values that encompass the middle 95\% of the standard normal distribution. If 95\% of the standard normal distribution should be in the middle, that leaves 5\% in the tails, or 2.5\% in each tail.

The \texttt{qnorm()} function in R will tell us the \(z^*\) value for the desired percentile (in this case, 95\% + 2.5\% = 97.5\% percentile).

  Enter the value of 0.975 for xx in the provided R script file.

The American Veterinary Medical Association estimated in 2010 that approximately 49\% of dog owners in the U.S. own dogs that are classified as ``mixed breed.'' As part of a larger 2022 international study (Banton 2022) about overall dog health, survey participants were asked, among other things, to report whether their dog was purebred or a mixed breed. Seven hundred and fifty (750) dog owners from the U.S. were recruited to complete an online survey via an email indicating they had been randomly selected by Qualtrics (an ``experience management'' company that specializes in surveys). Three hundred sixty-four (364) out of 675 respondents from the U.S. reported they owned a mixed breed dog. Is there evidence that, in the last decade, the proportion of dog owners in the U.S. that own a mixed breed dog has changed from the value reported in 2010?

A recent study examined hearing loss data for 1753 U.S. teenagers. In this sample, 328 were found to have some level of hearing loss. News of this study spread quickly, with many news articles blaming the prevalence of hearing loss on the higher use of ear buds by teens.

\section{Module 4 Review}\label{module-4-review}

Statistician Jessica Utts has conducted an extensive analysis of Ganzfeld studies that have investigated psychic functioning. Ganzfeld studies involve a ``sender'' and a ``receiver.'' Two people are placed in separate rooms. The sender looks at a ``target'' image on a television screen and attempts to transmit information about the target to the receiver. The receiver is then shown four possible choices or targets, one of which is the correct target and the other three are ``decoys.'' The receiver must choose the one he or she thinks best matches the description transmitted by the sender. If the correct target is chosen by the receiver, the session is a ``hit.'' Otherwise, it is a miss. Utts reported that her analysis considered a total of 2,124 sessions and found a total of 709 ``hits'' (Utts, 2010). Is there evidence of psychic ability?

Conditions for the sample distribution of \(\hat{p}\).

Standardized sample proportion.

The standardized statistic for theory-based methods for one proportion is:

Next we will use theory-based methods to estimate the parameter of interest.

To calculate a theory-based 95\% confidence interval for \(\pi\), we will first find the \textbf{standard error} of \(\hat{p}\) by plugging in the value of \(\hat{p}\) for \(\pi\) in \(SD(\hat{p})\):

\[SE(\hat{p}) = \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}\times(1-\hat{p})}{n}}.\]
Note that we do not include a ``0'' subscript, since we are not assuming a null hypothesis.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{10}
\tightlist
\item
  Calculate the standard error of the sample proportion to find a 95\% confidence interval.
\end{enumerate}

\vspace{0.5in}

To find the confidence interval, we will add and subtract the \textbf{margin of error} to the point estimate:

\[\text{point estimate}\pm\text{margin of error}\]
\[\hat{p}\pm z^* SE(\hat{p})\]

The \(z^*\) multiplier is the percentile of a standard normal distribution that corresponds to our confidence level. If our confidence level is 95\%, we find the Z values that encompass the middle 95\% of the standard normal distribution. If 95\% of the standard normal distribution should be in the middle, that leaves 5\% in the tails, or 2.5\% in each tail. The \texttt{qnorm()} function in \texttt{R} will tell us the \(z^*\) value for the desired percentile (in this case, 95\% + 2.5\% = 97.5\% percentile).

\chapter{Exploring Quantitative Data: Exploratory Data Analysis and Hypothesis Testing for a Single Quantitative Variable}\label{exploring-quantitative-data-exploratory-data-analysis-and-hypothesis-testing-for-a-single-quantitative-variable}

\section{Vocabulary Review and Key Topics}\label{vocabulary-review-and-key-topics-4}

Review the Golden Ticket posted in the resources at the end of the coursepack for a summary of a single quantitative variable.

\subsection{Key topics}\label{key-topics-5}

Module 6 will introduce exploratory data analysis and hypothesis testing using both simulation-based and theory-based methods for a single quantitative variable.
The \textbf{summary measure} for one quantitative variable is the \textbf{mean}.
Additionally, we can find the five number summary (min, Q1, median, Q3, max) as well as the sample standard deviation.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Notation for a sample mean: \(\bar{x}\)
\item
  Notation for a sample standard deviation: \(s\)
\item
  Notation for a population mean: \(\mu\)
\item
  Types of plots for a single categorical variable:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Histogram
  \item
    Boxplot
  \item
    Dotplot
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Mean}, \(\bar{x}\): the average
  \[ 
  \bar{x} = \frac{x_1 + x_2 + \cdots + x_n}{n},
  \]
  where \(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\) are the data values and \(n\) is the sample size.
\item
  \textbf{Median}: value at the 50th percentile; approximately 50\% of data values are at or below the value of the median.
\item
  \textbf{Quartile 1} (lower quartile), \(Q_1\): value at the 25th percentile; approximately 25\% of data values are at or below the value of \(Q_1\).
\item
  \textbf{Quartile 3} (upper quartile), \(Q_3\): value at the 75th percentile; approximately 75\% of data values are at or below the value of \(Q_3\).
\item
  \textbf{Sample standard deviation}, \(s\): on average, each value in the data set is \(s\) units from the mean of the data set (\(\bar{x}\)). We will always calculate \(s\) using R, but it is calculated using the following formula:
  \[
  \bar{x} = \frac{(x_1-\bar{x})^2 + (x_2-\bar{x})^2 + \cdots + (x_n-\bar{x})^2}{n},
  \]
  where \(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\) are the data values, \(\bar{x}\) is the sample mean, and \(n\) is the sample size.

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Theory-based Hypothesis Testing}\label{theory-based-hypothesis-testing}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Theory-based Hypothesis Testing}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Theory-based methods should give the same results as simulation-based methods if conditions are met. For a single quantitative variable, conditions are met if either the data themselves follow a normal distribution or if the sample size is large enough. We call this the ``normality condition.''
\item
  \textbf{Conditions for the sampling distribution of \(\bar{x}\) to follow an approximate normal distribution}:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    \textbf{Independence}: The sample's observations are independent, e.g., are from a simple random sample. (\emph{Remember}: This also must be true to use simulation methods!)
  \item
    \textbf{Normality Condition}: Either the sample observations come from a normally distributed population or we have a large enough sample size. To check this condition, use the the following rules of thumb:

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      \(n < 30\): The distribution of the sample must be approximately normal with no outliers.
    \item
      \(30 \ge n < 100\): We can relax the condition a little; the distribution of the sample must have no extreme outliers or skewness.
    \item
      \(n > 100\): Can assume the sampling distribution of \(\bar{x}\) is nearly normal, even if the underlying distribution of individual observations is not.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{t-distribution}: a theoretical distribution that is bell-shaped with mean zero. Its degrees of freedom determine the variability of the distribution. For very large degrees of freedom, the \(t\)-distribution is close to a standard normal distribution. For a single quantitative variable, the degrees of freedom are calculated by subtracting one from the sample size: \(n-1\). A \(t\)-distribution with \(n-1\) degrees of freedom is denoted by: \(t_{n-1}\).
\item
  \textbf{Standard error of the sample mean}: measures the how far each possible sample mean is from the true mean, on average, and is calculated using the formula below:
  \[SE(\bar{x})=\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}\]
  where \(s\) is the sample standard deviation.
\item
  \textbf{Standardized sample mean}: standardized statistic for a single quantitative variable calculated using:
  \[
  T = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu_0}{SE(\bar{x})},
  \]
  If the conditions for the sampling distribution of \(\bar{x}\) to follow an approximate normal distribution are met, and if the true value of \(\mu\) is equal to the null value of \(\mu_0\), the standardized sample mean, \(T\), will have an approximate \(t\)-distribution with \(n-1\) degrees of freedom.
\item
  The following R code is used to find the p-value using theory based methods for a single quantitative variables.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    \texttt{pt} will give you a p-value using the \(t\)-distribution with \(n-1\) df (enter for \texttt{yy})
  \item
    Enter the value of the standardized statistic for \texttt{xx}
  \item
    If a greater than alternative, change \texttt{lower.tail\ =\ TRUE} to FALSE.
  \item
    If a two-sided test, multiply by 2.
  \end{itemize}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{pt}\NormalTok{(xx, }\AttributeTok{df =}\NormalTok{ yy, }\AttributeTok{lower.tail=}\ConstantTok{TRUE}\NormalTok{)}

Notice that the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ has been pulled in the direction of the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ is a robust measure of center.
\item
  The \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ is a robust measure of spread.
\item
  Robust means not \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ by outliers.
\end{itemize}

When the distribution is symmetric use the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ as the measure of center and the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ as the measure of spread.

When the distribution is skewed with outliers use the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ as the measure of center and the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ as the measure of spread.

\item
  Identify and create appropriate summary statistics and plots given a data set or research question for quantitative data.
\item
  Interpret the following summary statistics in context:
  median, lower quartile, upper quartile,
  standard deviation, interquartile range.

\subsection{Terminology review}\label{terminology-review-9}

In today's activity, we will review summary measures and plots for quantitative variables. Some terms covered in this activity are:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Two measures of center: mean, median
\item
  Two measures of spread (variability): standard deviation, interquartile range (IQR)
\item
  Plots of quantitative variables: dotplots, boxplots, histograms
\item
  Given a plot or set of plots, describe and compare the distribution(s)
  of quantitative variables
  (center, variability, shape, outliers).
\end{itemize}

To review these concepts, see Chapter 5 in the textbook.

The \texttt{favstats()} function from the \texttt{mosaic} package gives the summary statistics for a quantitative variable. The \texttt{R} output below provides the summary statistics for the variable \texttt{Graduation\_Rate}. The summary statistics provided are the two measures of center (mean and median) and two measures of spread (standard deviation and the quartile values to calculate the IQR) for undergraduate 6-year graduation rate.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Highlight and run lines 1--12 in the provided \texttt{R} script file to load the data set. Check that the summary statistics match the output given in the coursepack.
\item
  Notice that the 2-year institutions were removed so the observational units for this study are \textbf{4-year US degree-granting higher education institutions in 2018.}

\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Displaying a single quantitative variable}

There are three type of plots used to plot a single quantitative variable: a dotplot, a histogram or a boxplot. A dotplot of graduation rates would plot a dot for the graduation rate for each 4-year US higher education institution.

First, let's create a histogram of the variable \texttt{Graduation\_Rate}.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Enter the name of the variable in line 19 for \texttt{variable} in the R script file.
\item
  Replace the word title for the plot in line 21 between the quotations with a descriptive title. \textbf{A title should include: type of plot, variable or variables plotted, and observational units.}
\item
  Highlight and run the following lines to create the histogram.
\end{itemize}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{IPEDS }\SpecialCharTok{\%\textgreater{}\%} \CommentTok{\# Data set piped into...}

  \FunctionTok{geom\_histogram}\NormalTok{(}\AttributeTok{binwidth =} \DecValTok{10}\NormalTok{) }\SpecialCharTok{+}  \CommentTok{\# Create histogram with specified binwidth}
  \FunctionTok{labs}\NormalTok{(}\AttributeTok{title =} \StringTok{"Don\textquotesingle{}t forget to title the plot!"}\NormalTok{, }\CommentTok{\# Title for plot}

       \AttributeTok{y =} \StringTok{"Frequency"}\NormalTok{) }\CommentTok{\# Label for y axis}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Notice that the \textbf{bin width} for the histogram is 10. For example the first bin consists of the number of institutions in the data set with a graduation rate of 0 to 10\%. It is important to note that a graduation rate on the boundary of a bin will fall into the bin above it; for example, 20 would be counted in the bin 20--30.

Next we will create a boxplot of the variable \texttt{Graduation\_Rate}.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Enter the name of the variable in line 19 for \texttt{variable} in the R script file.
\item
  Highlight and run the following lines to create the boxplot.

\end{Shaded}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{6}

\item
  Sketch the boxplot created and identify the values of the 5-number summary (minimum value, \(Q_1\), median, \(Q_3\), maximum value) on the plot. Use the following formulas to find the invisible fence on both ends of the distribution. Draw a dotted line at the invisible fence to show how the outliers were detected (any values less than the lower fence or greater than the upper fence were flagged as outliers).
\end{enumerate}

\[\text{Lower Fence:} ~~~ Q_1 - 1.5\times IQR\]

\[\text{Upper Fence:} ~~~ Q_3 + 1.5\times IQR\]
\vspace{1.8in}

When describing distributions of quantitative variables we discuss the \textbf{shape} (symmetric or skewed), the \textbf{center} (mean or median), \textbf{spread} (standard deviation or IQR), and if there are \textbf{outliers} present.

\item
  Histograms, box plots, and dot plots can all be used to graphically display a single quantitative variable.
\item
  The box plot is created using the five number summary: minimum value, quartile 1, median, quartile 3, and maximum value. Whiskers extend to the lowest value and highest value that are \emph{not} considered outliers. Values in the data set that are less than \(Q_1 - 1.5\times IQR\) or greater than \(Q_3 + 1.5\times IQR\) are considered outliers and are graphically represented by a dot outside of the whiskers on the box plot.
\item
  Data should be summarized numerically and displayed graphically to give us information about the study.
\item
  When comparing distributions of quantitative variables we look at the shape, center, spread, and for outliers. In this course, we only consider two measures of center (mean and the median), and two measures of spread (standard deviation and the interquartile range, \(IQR = Q_3 - Q_1\)).

\subsection{College student sleep habits}\label{college-student-sleep-habits}

According to the an article in \emph{Sleep} (Watson 2015), experts recommend adults (\textgreater18) get at least 7 hours of sleep per night. A survey was sent to students in four sections of Stat 216 asking about their sleep habits. Is there evidence that sleep college students get less than the recommended 7 hours of sleep per night, on average?

\subsection*{Simulation methods}\label{simulation-methods}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Simulation methods}

To simulate the null distribution of sample means we will use a bootstrapping method. Recall that the null distribution must be created under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true. Therefore, before bootstrapping, we will need to \emph{shift} each data point by the difference \(\mu_0 - \bar{x}\). This will ensure that the mean of the shifted data is \(\mu_0\) (rather than the mean of the original data, \(\bar{x}\)), and that the simulated null distribution will be centered at the null value.

\subsection{Body Temperature}\label{body-temperature}

It has long been reported that the mean body temperature of adults is \(98.6^{\circ}\)F. There have been a few articles that challenge this assertion. In 2018, a sample of 52 Stat 216 undergraduates, were asked to report their body temperature. Is there evidence that body temperatures of adults differ from the known temperature of \(98.6^{\circ}\)F?

In general, the sampling distribution for a sample mean, \(\bar{x}\), based on a sample of size \(n\) from a population with a true mean \(\mu\) and true standard deviation \(\sigma\) can be modeled using a Normal distribution when certain conditions are met.

Conditions for the sampling distribution of \(\bar{x}\) to follow an approximate Normal distribution:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Independence}: The sample's observations are independent. For paired data, that means each pairwise difference should be independent.
\item
  \textbf{Normality}: The data should be approximately normal or the sample size should be large.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    \(n < 30\): If the sample size \(n\) is less than 30 and the distribution of the data is approximately normal with no clear outliers in the data, then we typically assume the data come from a nearly normal distribution to satisfy the condition.
  \item
    \(30 \leq n < 100\): If the sample size \(n\) is betwe 30 and 100 and there are no particularly extreme outliers in the data, then we typically assume the sampling distribution of \(\bar{x}\) is nearly normal, even if the underlying distribution of individual observations is not.
  \item
    \(n \geq 100\): If the sample size \(n\) is at least 100 (regardless of the presence of skew or outliers), we typically assume the sampling distribution of \(\bar{x}\) is nearly normal, even if the underlying distribution of individual observations is not.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{06-A13-quantitative_theory_files/figure-latex/tdist-1} 

}

\caption{Comparison of the standard Normal vs t-distribution with various degrees of freedom}\label{fig:tdist}
\end{figure}

Like we saw in Chapter \textbf{5}, we will not know the values of the parameters and must use the sample data to estimate them. Unlike with proportions, in which we only needed to estimate the population proportion, \(\pi\), quantitative sample data must be used to estimate both a population mean \(\mu\) and a population standard deviation \(\sigma\). This additional uncertainty will require us to use a theoretical distribution that is just a bit wider than the Normal distribution. Enter the \textbf{\(t\)-distribution}!

As you can seen from Figure \ref{fig:tdist}, the \(t\)-distributions (dashed and dotted lines) are centered at 0 just like a standard Normal distribution (solid line), but are slightly wider. The variability of a \(t\)-distribution depends on its degrees of freedom, which is calculated from the sample size of a study. (For a single sample of \(n\) observations or paired differences, the degrees of freedom is equal to \(n-1\).) Recall from previous classes that larger sample sizes tend to result in narrower sampling distributions. We see that here as well. The larger the sample size, the larger the degrees of freedom, the narrower the \(t\)-distribution. (In fact, a \(t\)-distribution with infinite degrees of freedom actually IS the standard Normal distribution!)

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    \textbf{Independence}: The sample's observations are independent, e.g., are from a simple random sample. (\emph{Remember}: This also must be true to use simulation methods!)
  \item
    \textbf{Large enough sample size: Normality Condition}: The sample observations come from a normally distributed population. To check use the the following rules of thumb:

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      \(n < 30\): The distribution of the sample must be approximately normal with no outliers
    \item
      \(30 \ge n < 100\): We can relax the condition a little; the distribution of the sample must have no extreme outliers or skewness
    \item
      \(n > 100\): Can assume the sampling distribution of \(\bar{x}\) is nearly normal, even if the underlying distribution of individual observational is not

\subsection{College Textbook Cost}\label{college-textbook-cost}

A college student spends on average \$280 on textbooks per year. Many universities have starting using opensource resources to help defray the cost of textbooks. One such university is hoping to show they have successfully reduced costs by \$100, on average.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Write the parameter of interest (\(\mu\)) in words, in the context of this problem.
  \vspace{0.5in}
\item
  Use proper notation to write the null and alternative hypothesis the university would need to test in order to check their claim.
  \vspace{0.5in}
\end{enumerate}

After determining hypotheses and prior to collecting data, researchers should set a \textbf{significance level} for a hypothesis test. The significance level, represented by \(\alpha\) and most commonly 0.01, 0.05, or 0.10, is a cut-off for determining whether a p-value is small or not. The \emph{smaller} the p-value, the \emph{stronger} the evidence against the null hypothesis, so a p-value that is smaller than or equal to the significance level is strong enough evidence to \emph{reject the null hypothesis}. Similarly, the \emph{larger} the p-value, the \emph{weaker} the evidence against the null hypothesis, so a p-value that is larger than the significance level does not provide enough evidence against the null hypothesis and the researcher would \emph{fail to reject the null hypothesis}. Rejecting the null hypothesis or failing to reject the null hypothesis are the two \textbf{decisions} that can be made based on the data collected.

As you have already learned in this course, sample size of a study is extremely important. Often times, researchers will conduct what is called a power analysis to determine the appropriate sample size based on the goals of their research, including a desired \textbf{power} of their test. Power is the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis, or the probability of the data providing strong evidence against the null hypothesis \emph{when the null hypothesis is false}.

The remainder of this activity will be spent investigating how different factors influence the power of a test, after which you will complete a power analysis for this physical therapy company.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Navigate to \url{https://istats.shinyapps.io/power/}.
\item
  Choose the tab \texttt{Population\ Mean}
\item
  Use the scale under ``Null Hypothesis value \(\mu_0\)'' to change the value to your null value from question 2. *Note we will convert this to a scale \$100 dollars. In other words, use the null value of 2.8.
\item
  Change the ``Alternative Hypothesis'' to the direction you wrote in question 2.
\item
  Leave all boxes un-checked.
\item
  Set the ``True value of \(\mu\)'' to 2.8 as well
\item
  Do not change the scales for ``Sample size n'' or ``Type I Error \(\alpha\)''
\end{itemize}

The red distribution you see is the scaled-Normal distribution representing the null distribution for this hypothesis test, if the sample size was 30 and the significance level was 0.05. This means the red distribution is showing the probability of each possible sample mean of college students who spent \$280 on textbooks per year (\(\bar{x}\)) if we assume the null hypothesis is true.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{2}
\item
  Based off this distribution and your alternative hypothesis, give one possible sample mean which you think would lead to rejecting the null hypothesis. Explain how you decided on your value.
  \vspace{0.25in}
\item
  Check the box for ``Show Critical Value(s) and Rejection Region(s)''. You will now see a vertical line on the plot indicating the \emph{minimum} sample mean which would lead to reject the null hypothesis. What is this value?\\
  \vspace{0.25in}
\item
  Notice that there are some sample means under the red line (when the null hypothesis is true) which would lead us to reject the null hypothesis. Give the range of sample means which would lead to rejecting the null hypothesis when the null hypothesis is true? What is the statistical name for this mistake?
  \vspace{0.4in}
\end{enumerate}

Check the ``Type I Error'' box under \textbf{Display}. This should verify (or correct) your answer to question 5! The area shaded in red represents the probability of making a \textbf{Type 1 Error} in our hypothesis test. Recall that a Type 1 Error is when we reject the null hypothesis even though the null hypothesis is true. To reject the null hypothesis, the p-value, which was found assuming the null hypothesis is true, must be less than or equal to the significance level. Therefore the significance level is the maximum probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when the null hypothesis is true, so the significance level IS the probability of making a Type 1 Error in a hypothesis test!

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{5}
\tightlist
\item
  Based on the current applet settings, What percent of the null distribution is shaded red (what is the probability of making a Type 1 Error)?
  \vspace{0.25in}
\end{enumerate}

Let's say this university believes their program can reduce the cost of textbooks for college students by \$100 per year. In the applet, set the scale under ``True value of \(\mu\)'' to 1.8.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{6}
\tightlist
\item
  Where is the blue distribution centered?
  \vspace{0.25in}
\end{enumerate}

The blue distribution that appears represents what the university believes, that \$180 (not \$280) is the true mean textbook cost for college students at this university. This blue distribution represents the idea that the \textbf{null hypothesis is false}.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{7}
\tightlist
\item
  Consider the definition of power provided earlier in this lab. Do you believe the power of the test will be an area within the blue distribution or red distribution? How do you know? What about the probability of making a Type 2 Error?
  \vspace{1in}
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item

\subsection{Arsenic}\label{arsenic}

Scientists have devised a new way to measure a person's level of arsenic poisoning by examining toenail clippings. Scientists measured the arsenic levels (in parts per million or ppm) in toenail clippings from 19 randomly selected individuals with private wells in New Hampshire (data in the table below). An arsenic level greater than 0.150 ppm is considered hazardous. Is there evidence the ground water in New Hampshire has hazardous levels of arsenic concentration (as seen in the arsenic levels of New Hampshire residents)? How high is the arsenic concentration for New Hampshire residents with a private well?

\chapter{Exploratory Data Analysis and Simulation-based Inference for Two Categorical Variables}\label{exploratory-data-analysis-and-simulation-based-inference-for-two-categorical-variables}

\section{Vocabulary Review and Key Topics}\label{vocabulary-review-and-key-topics-6}

Review the Golden Ticket posted in the resources at the end of the coursepack for a summary of a two categorical variables.

\subsection{Key topics}\label{key-topics-7}

Module 8 will introduce exploratory data analysis and simulation-based inference for two categorical variables. We also explore study design and confounding variables.

Types of plots for two categorical variables

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Segmented bar plot}: plots the conditional proportion of the response outcomes in each explanatory variable group

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    The plot shows no association between the variables, if the height of each segment is approximately the same in each group
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Mosaic plot}: similar to the segmented bar plot but the sample size is reflected by the width of the bars
\end{itemize}

Summary measures

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Difference in proportion}: calculation of the difference in two conditional proportions

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Parameter notation: \(\pi_1 - \pi_2\)
  \item
    Sample notation: \(\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2\)
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Relative risk}: the ratio of the conditional proportions

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \(\text{Relative Risk} = \frac{\hat{p}_1}{\hat{p}_2}\)
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Interpretation of relative risk:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The risk of success in group 1 is relative risk times the risk of success in group 2
\item
  Can also interpret as a percent increase or percent decrease in risk

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    \[(RR-1) \times 100\%\]
  \item
    The risk of success in group 1 is xx\% higher or lower that the risk of success in group 2
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Explanatory variable: the variable researchers think \emph{may be} affecting the other variable.
\item
  Response variable: the variable researchers think \emph{may be} influenced by the other variable.
\item
  Confounding variable:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    associated with both the explanatory and the response variable
  \item
    explains the association shown by the data
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Example: It is well known that humans have more difficulty differentiating between faces of people from different races than people within their own race. A 2018 study published in the Journal of Experimental Psychology (Levin 2000): Human Perception and Performance investigated a similar phenomenon with gender. In the study, volunteers were shown several pictures of strangers. Half the volunteers were randomly assigned to rate the attractiveness of the individuals pictured. The other half were told to rate the distinctiveness of the faces seen. Both groups were then shown a slideshow of faces (some that had been rated in the first part of the study, some that were new to the volunteer) and asked to determine if each face was old or new. Researchers found people were better able to recognize faces of their own gender when asked to rate the distinctiveness of the faces, compared to when asked to rate the attractiveness of the faces.

  Scope of inference
\item

\item

\subsection{Atrial fibrillation}\label{atrial-fibrillation}

Atrial fibrillation is an irregular and often elevated heart rate. In some people, atrial fibrillation will come and go on its own, but others will experience this condition on a permanent basis. When atrial fibrillation is constant, medications are required to stabilize the patient's heart rate and to help prevent blood clots from forming. Pharmaceutical scientists at a large pharmaceutical company believe they have developed a new medication that effectively stabilizes heart rates in people with permanent atrial fibrillation. They set out to conduct a trial study to investigate the new drug. The scientists will need to compare the proportion of patients whose heart rate is stabilized between two groups of subjects, one of whom is given a placebo and the other given the new medication.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Identify the explanatory and response variable in this trial study.

  Explanatory variable:
  \vspace{0.5in}

  Response variable:
  \vspace{0.5in}
\end{enumerate}

\newpage

Suppose 24 subjects with permanent atrial fibrillation have volunteered to participate in this study. There are 16 subjects that self-identified as male and 8 subjects that self-identified as female.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item
  One way to separate into two groups would be to give all the males the placebo and all the females the new drug. Explain why this is not a reasonable strategy.
  \vspace{1in}
\item
  Could the scientists fix the problem with the strategy presented in question 2 by creating equal sized groups by putting 4 males and 8 females into the drug group and the remaining 12 males in the placebo group? Explain your answer.
  \vspace{0.5in}
\item
  A third strategy would be to \textbf{block} on sex. In this type of study, the scientists would assign 4 females and 8 males to each group. Using this strategy, out of the 12 individuals in each group what \textbf{proportion} are males?
  \vspace{0.3in}
\item
  Assume the scientists used the strategy in question 4, but they put the four tallest females and eight tallest males into the drug group and the remaining subjects into the placebo group. They found that the proportion of patients whose heart rate stabilized is higher in the drug group than the placebo group.\\
  \vspace{0.1in}

  Could that difference be due to the sex of the subjects? Explain your answer.
  \vspace{0.5in}

  Could it be due to other variables? Explain your answer.
  \vspace{0.5in}
\end{enumerate}

While the strategy presented in question 5 controlled for the sex of the subject, there are more potential \textbf{confounding variables} in the study. A confounding variable is a variable that is \emph{both}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  associated with the explanatory variable, \emph{and}
\item
  associated with the response variable.
\end{enumerate}

When both these conditions are met, if we observe an association between the explanatory variable and the response variable in the data, we cannot be sure if this association is due to the explanatory variable or the confounding variable---the explanatory and confounding variables are ``confounded.''

\textbf{Random assignment} means that subjects in a study have an equally likely chance of receiving any of the available treatments.

\newpage

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{5}
\tightlist
\item
  You will now investigate how randomly assigning subjects impacts a study's scope of inference.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Navigate to the ``Randomizing Subjects'' applet under the ``Other Applets'' heading at: \url{http://www.rossmanchance.com/ISIapplets.html}. This applet lists the sex and height of each of the 24 subjects. Click ``Show Graphs'' to see a bar chart showing the sex of each subject. Currently, the applet is showing the strategy outlined in question 3.
\item
  Click ``Randomize''.
\end{itemize}

~~~In this random assignment, what proportion of males are in group 1 (the placebo group)?

\vspace{0.1in}

~~~What proportion of males are in group 2 (the drug group)?

\vspace{0.1in}

~~~What is the difference in proportion of males between the two groups (placebo - drug)?

\vspace{0.1in}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{6}
\item
  Notice the difference in the two proportions is shown as a dot in the plot at the bottom of the web page. Un-check the box for Animate above ``Randomize'' and click ``Randomize'' again. Did you get the same difference in proportion of males between the placebo and drug groups?
  \vspace{0.25in}
\item
  Change ``Replications'' to 998 (for 1000 total). Click ``Randomize'' again. Sketch the plot of the distribution of difference in proportions from each of the 1000 random assignments here. Be sure to include a descriptive \(x\)-axis label.
  \vspace{1.25in}
\item
  Does random assignment \emph{always} balance the placebo and drug groups based on the sex of the participants? Does random assignment \emph{tend} to make the placebo and drug groups \emph{roughly} the same with respect to the distribution of sex? Use your plot from question 8 to justify your answers.
  \vspace{0.5in}
\item
  Change the drop-down menu below Group 2 from ``sex'' to ``height''. The applet now calculates the average height in the placebo and drug groups for each of the 1000 random assignments. The dot plot displays the distribution of the difference in mean heights (placebo - drug) for each random assignment. Based on this dot plot, is height distributed equally, on average, between the two groups? Explain how you know.
  \vspace{0.5in}
\end{enumerate}

\newpage

The diagram below summarizes these ideas about confounding variables and random assignment. When a confounding variable is present (such as sex or height), and an association is found in a study, it is impossible to discern what caused the change in the response variable. Is the change the result of the explanatory variable or the confounding variable? However, if all confounding variables are \emph{balanced} across the treatment groups, then only the explanatory variable differs between the groups and thus \emph{must have caused} the change seen in the response variable.

Can the scientists conclude the new drug \emph{caused} the increased chance of stabilization? Explain your answer.

\subsection{Scope of Inference}\label{scope-of-inference-1}

The two main study designs we will cover are \textbf{observational studies} and \textbf{experiments}. In observational studies, researchers have no influence over which subjects are in each group being compared (though they can control other variables in the study). An experiment is defined by assignment of the treatment groups of the \emph{explanatory variable}, typically via random assignment.

For the next exercises identify the study design (observational study or experiment), the sampling method, and the scope of inference.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{14}
\item
  The pharmaceutical company Moderna Therapeutics, working in conjunction with the National Institutes of Health, conducted Phase 3 clinical trials of a vaccine for COVID-19 in the Fall of 2021. US clinical research sites enrolled 30,000 volunteers without COVID-19 to participate. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either the candidate vaccine or a saline placebo. They were then followed to assess whether or not they developed COVID-19. The trial was double-blind, so neither the investigators nor the participants knew who was assigned to which group.

\subsection{Take-home messages}\label{take-home-messages-15}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  The study design (observational study vs, experiment) determines if we can draw causal inferences or not. If an association is detected, a randomized experiment allows us to conclude that there is a causal (cause-and-effect) relationship between the explanatory and response variable. Observational studies have potential confounding variables within the study that prevent us from inferring a causal relationship between the variables studied.
\item
  Confounding variables are variables not included in the study that are related to both the explanatory and the response variables. When there are potential confounding variables in the study we cannot draw causal inferences.
\item
  Random assignment balances confounding variables across treatment groups. This eliminates any possible confounding variables by breaking the connections between the explanatory variable and the potential confounding variables.
\item
  Observational studies will always carry the possibility of confounding variables. Randomized experiments, which use random assignment, will have no confounding variables.

In the following questions, use the table to calculate the described proportions. Notation is important for each calculation. Since this is sample data, it is appropriate to use statistic notation for the proportion, \(\hat{p}\). When calculating a proportion dependent on a single level of a variable, subscripts are needed when reporting the notation.

Two types of plots can be created to display two categorical variables. To examine the differences in level of myopia for the level of light, we will first create a segmented bar plot of \texttt{Light} segmented by \texttt{Sight}. To create the segmented bar plot enter the variable name, \texttt{Light} for \texttt{explanatory} and the variable name, \texttt{Sight} for \texttt{response} in the R script file in line 35. Highlight and run lines 34--40.

  Bar charts can be used to graphically display a single categorical variable either as counts or proportions. Segmented bar charts and mosaic plots are used to display two categorical variables.
\item
  Segmented bar charts always have a scale from 0 - 100\%. The bars represent the outcomes of the explanatory variable. Each bar is segmented by the response variable. If the heights of each segment are the same for each bar there is no association between variables.
\item
  Mosaic plots are similar to segmented bar charts but the widths of the bars also show the number of observations within each outcome.

\subsection{The Good Samaritan}\label{the-good-samaritan}

Researchers at the Princeton University wanted to investigate influences on behavior (Darley and Batson 1973). The researchers randomly selected 67 students from the Princeton Theological Seminary to participate in a study. Only 47 students chose to participate in the study, and the data below includes 40 of those students (7 students were removed from the study for various reasons). As all participants were theology majors planning a career as a preacher, the expectation was that all would have a similar disposition when it comes to helping behavior. Each student was then shown a 5-minute presentation on the Good Samaritan, a parable in the Bible which emphasizes the importance of helping others. After the presentation, the students were told they needed to give a talk on the Good Samaritan parable at a building across campus. Half the students were told they were late for the presentation; the other half told they could take their time getting across campus (the condition was randomly assigned). On the way between buildings, an actor pretending to be a homeless person in distress asked the student for help. The researchers recorded whether the student helped the actor or not. The results of the study are shown in the table below. Do these data provide evidence that those in a hurry will be less likely to help people in need in this situation? Use the order of subtraction hurry -- no hurry.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}\hline
& Hurry Condition & No Hurry Condition & Total \\ \hline
Helped Actor & 2 & 11 & 13 \\ \hline
Did Not Help Actor & 18 & 9 & 27 \\ \hline
Total & 20 & 20 & 40 \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

These counts can be found in R by using the \texttt{count()} function:

\begin{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Ask a research question}\label{ask-a-research-question-3}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Ask a research question}

The research question as stated above is: Do these data provide evidence that those in a hurry will be less likely to help people in need in this situation? In order to set up our hypotheses, we need to express this research question in terms of parameters.

Remember, we define the parameter for a single categorical variable as the true proportion of observational units that are labeled as a ``success'' in the response variable.

For this study we are identifying two parameters and looking at the difference between these two parameters.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \(\pi_\text{hurry}\) = long-run proportion of Princeton Theological Seminary students assigned to hurry that helped the actor
\item
  \(\pi_\text{no hurry}\) = long-run proportion of Princeton Theological Seminary students assigned not to hurry that helped the actor
\item
  \(\pi_\text{hurry} - \pi_\text{no hurry}\) = the difference in long-run proporiton of Princeton Theological Seminary Students that helped the actor between those who were assigned to hurry and those who were not assigned to hurry
\end{itemize}

When comparing two groups, we assume the two parameters are equal in the null hypothesis---there is no association between the variables.

\item
  Start with 40 cards (13 labeled helped, 27 labeled did not help)

\subsection{Key topics}\label{key-topics-8}

Module 9 introduces theory-based hypothesis testing methods and both simulation-based and theory-based confidence intervals for two categorical variables.

Conditions for the sampling distribution of \(\hat{p}_1-\hat{p}_2\) to follow an approximate normal distribution:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Independence}: The data are independent within and between the two groups. (\emph{Remember}: This also must be true to use simulation methods!)
\item
  \textbf{Success-failure condition}: This condition is met if we have at least 10 successes and 10 failures in each sample. Equivalently, we check that all cells in the table have at least 10 observations.
\item
  Calculation of standard error assuming the null is true:
\end{itemize}

\[SE(\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2) = \sqrt{\hat{p}_{pooled} \times (1-\hat{p}_{pooled}) \times (\frac{1}{n_1}+\frac{1}{n_2})}\]

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Calculation of the standardized difference in sample proportion:
\end{itemize}

\[t = \frac{\hat{p}_1-\hat{p}_2-0}{SE(\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2)}\]

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Measures the number of standard errors the sample difference in proportions is above or below the null value of zero
\item
  Calculation of the difference in sample proportion not assuming the null is true
\end{itemize}

\[SE(\hat{p}_1-\hat{p}_2) = \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}_1 \times  (1-\hat{p}_1)}{n_1}+\frac{\hat{p}_2 \times  (1-\hat{p}_2)}{n_2}}\]

Example: In Modules 3 and 4, we investigated data on higher education institutions in the United States, collected by the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) for the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) (Education Statistics 2018). A random sample of 2900+ higher education institutions in the United States was collected in 2018. Two variables measured on this data set is whether the institution is a land grant university and whether the institution offers tenure. Does the proportion of universities that offer tenure differ between land grant and non-land-grant institutions?

  Standard normal distribution
\item
  Independence and success-failure conditions
\end{itemize}

To review these concepts, see Chapter 15 in your textbook.

\subsection{Winter sports helmet use and head injury}\label{winter-sports-helmet-use-and-head-injury}

In this activity we will focus on theory-based methods to calculate a confidence interval. The sampling distribution of a difference in proportions can be mathematically modeled using the normal distribution if certain conditions are met.

Conditions for the sampling distribution of \(\hat{p}_1-\hat{p}_2\) to follow an approximate normal distribution:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Independence}: The data are independent within and between the two groups. (\emph{Remember}: This also must be true to use simulation methods!)
\item
  \textbf{Success-failure condition}: This condition is met if we have at least 10 successes and 10 failures in each sample. Equivalently, we check that all cells in the table have at least 10 observations.
\end{itemize}

A study was reported in ``Helmet Use and Risk of Head Injuries in Alpine Skiers and Snowboarders'' by Sullheim et. al., (Sulheim et al. 2017), on the use of helmets and head injuries for skiers and snowboarders involved in accidents.

\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Use statistical analysis methods to draw inferences from the data}

To test the null hypothesis, we could use simulation-based methods as we did in the activities in Module 7. In this activity, we will focus on theory-based methods. Like with a single proportion, the sampling distribution of a difference in sample proportions can be mathematically modeled using the normal distribution if certain conditions are met.

To calculate the standardized statistic we use:

\[
Z = \frac{(\hat{p_1} - \hat{p_2}) - \text{null value}}{SE_0(\hat{p_1}-\hat{p}_2)},
\]

where the null standard error is calculated using the pooled proportion of successes:

\[
SE_0(\hat{p}_1-\hat{p}_2)=\sqrt{\hat{p}_{pool}\times (1-\hat{p}_{pool})\times \left(\frac{1}{n_1}+\frac{1}{n_2}\right)}.
\]
For this study we would first calculate the pooled proportion of successes.

\[\hat{p}_{pool} = \frac{\text{number of "successes"}}{\text{number of cases}} \]

Note that the sample proportions for each group are the same as the smaller sample size.

\[\hat{p}_h = \frac{135}{1056}=0.128, \hspace{2mm} \hat{p}_n = \frac{674}{3944}=0.171\]

First calculate the pooled proportion of successes.

\[\hat{p}_{pool} = \frac{\text{number of "successes"}}{\text{number of cases}} = \frac{809}{5000} = 0.162\]

We use the value for the pooled proportion of successes to calculate the \(SE_0(\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2)\).

\[
SE_0(\hat{p}_1-\hat{p}_2)=\sqrt{0.162 \times (1-0.162)\times \left(\frac{1}{1056}+\frac{1}{3944}\right)} = 0.013
\]

\[Z = \frac{0.128 - 0.171 - 0}{0.013} = -3.308\]

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Simulation-based methods and theory-based methods should give similar results for a study \emph{if the validity conditions are met}. For both methods, observational units need to be independent. To use theory-based methods, additionally, the success-failure condition must be met. Check the validity conditions for each type of test to determine if theory-based methods can be used.
\item
  When calculating the standard error for the difference in sample proportions when doing a hypothesis test, we use the pooled proportion of successes, the best estimate for calculating the variability \emph{under the assumption the null hypothesis is true}. For a confidence interval, we are not assuming a null hypothesis, so we use the values of the two conditional proportions to calculate the standard error. Make note of the difference in these two formulas.
\item
  Increasing sample size will result in less sample-to-sample variability in statistics, which will result in a smaller standard error, and a larger standardized statistic.

Researchers compared the efficacy of two treatment regimens to achieve durable glycemic control in children and adolescents with recent-onset type 2 diabetes (Group 2012). A convenience sample of patients 10 to 17 years of age with recent-onset type 2 diabetes were randomly assigned to either a medication (rosiglitazone) or a lifestyle-intervention program focusing on weight loss through eating and activity. Researchers measured whether the patient still needs insulin (failure) or had glycemic control (success). Of the 233 children who received the Rosiglitazone treatment, 143 had glycemic control, while of the 234 who went through the lifestyle-intervention program, 125 had glycemic control. Is there evidence that there is difference in proportion of patients that achieve durable glycemic control between the two treatments? Use Rosiglitazone -- Lifestyle as the order of subtraction.

To find a confidence interval for the difference in proportions we will add and subtract the margin of error from the point estimate to find the two endpoints.

\[\hat{p}_1-\hat{p}_2\pm z^*\times SE(\hat{p}_1-\hat{p}_2), \hspace{.2cm} \text{where}\]
\[SE(\hat{p}_1-\hat{p}_2) = \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}_1 \times  (1-\hat{p}_1)}{n_1}+\frac{\hat{p}_2 \times  (1-\hat{p}_2)}{n_2}}\]

In this formula, we use the sample proportions for each group to calculate the standard error for the difference in proportions since we are not assuming that the true difference is zero.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}

\item
  Calculate the standard error of the sample proportion not assuming the null hypothesis is true.
\end{enumerate}

\vspace{1in}

Recall that the \(z^*\) multiplier is the percentile of a standard normal distribution that corresponds to our confidence level. If our confidence level is 90\%, we find the Z values that encompass the middle 90\% of the standard normal distribution. If 90\% of the standard normal distribution should be in the middle, that leaves 10\% in the tails, or 5\% in each tail. The \texttt{qnorm()} function in R will tell us the \(z^*\) value for the desired percentile (in this case, 90\% + 5\% = 95\% percentile).

\subsection{Poisonous Mushrooms}\label{poisonous-mushrooms}

Wild mushrooms, such as chanterelles or morels, are delicious, but eating wild mushrooms carries the risk of accidental poisoning. Even a single bite of the wrong mushroom can be enough to cause fatal poisoning. An amateur mushroom hunter is interested in finding an easy rule to differentiate poisonous and edible mushrooms. They think that the mushroom's gills (the part which holds and releases spores) might be related to a mushroom's edibility. They used a data set of 8124 mushrooms and their descriptions. For each mushroom, the data set includes whether it is edible (e) or poisonous (p) and the size of the gills (broad (b) or narrow (n)). Is there evidence gill size is associated with whether a mushroom is poisonous? PLEASE NOTE: According to The Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Mushrooms, there is no simple rule for determining the edibility of a mushroom; no rule like ``leaflets three, let it be'\,' for Poisonous Oak and Ivy.

\section{Module 6 Review - One Mean Testing}\label{module-6-review---one-mean-testing}

There are about 4 million tourists to Yellowstone National Park per year. One of the most visited sites within the park is the Old Faithful Geyser. The reason this geyser is called old faithful is because of the regularity of eruptions. Tourists report a typical wait time of 30 minutes, on average. A sample of 299 tourists reported their wait time to see Old Faithful erupt. Is there evidence that the average wait time differs from 30 minutes?

Now let's focus on theory-based methods.

Conditions for the sampling distribution of \(\bar{x}\) to follow an approximate Normal distribution:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Independence}: The sample's observations are independent. For paired data, that means each pairwise difference should be independent.
\item
  \textbf{Normality}: The data should be approximately normal or the sample size should be large.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    \(n < 30\): If the sample size \(n\) is less than 30 and the distribution of the data is approximately normal with no clear outliers in the data, then we typically assume the data come from a nearly normal distribution to satisfy the condition.
  \item
    \(30 \leq n < 100\): If the sample size \(n\) is betwe 30 and 100 and there are no particularly extreme outliers in the data, then we typically assume the sampling distribution of \(\bar{x}\) is nearly normal, even if the underlying distribution of individual observations is not.
  \item
    \(n \geq 100\): If the sample size \(n\) is at least 100 (regardless of the presence of skew or outliers), we typically assume the sampling distribution of \(\bar{x}\) is nearly normal, even if the underlying distribution of individual observations is not.

In the last 10 years, the proportion of children who are allergic to peanuts has doubled in Western countries. However, the allergy is not very common in some other countries where peanut protein is an important part of peoples' diets. The LEAP randomized trial, reported by Du Toit, et.al in the New England Journal of Medicine in February 2015 identified over 500 children ages 4 to 10 months who showed some sensitivity to peanut protein. They randomly assigned them to two groups:

• Peanut avoiders: parents were told to not give their kids any food which contained peanuts

• Peanut eaters: parents were given a snack containing peanut protein and told to feed it to their child several times per week (target dose was at least 6g of peanut protein per week).

At age 5 years, children were tested with a standard skin prick to see if they had an allergic reaction to peanut protein (yes or no). Is there evidence that exposure to peanuts reduces the likelihood of developing peanut allergies?

Example 2: Thirty dogs were selected at random from those residing at the humane society last month. The 30 dogs were split at random into two groups. The first group of 15 dogs was trained to perform a certain task using a reward method. The second group of 15 dogs was trained to perform the same task using a reward-punishment method.

Example 3: Fifty skiers volunteered to study how different waxes impacted their downhill race times. The participants were split into groups of two based on similar race times from the previous race. One of the two then had their skis treated with Wax A while the other was treated with Wax B. The downhill ski race times were then measured for each of the 25 volunteers who used Wax A as well as for each of the 25 volunteers who used Wax B.

\subsection{Tattoo Effect on Sweat Rate}\label{tattoo-effect-on-sweat-rate}

The popularity of tattoos has increased tremendously in the last 10 years particularly among athletes and military personnel. A study reported in \emph{Medicine \& Science in Sports \& Exercise} (LUETKEMEIER 2017) looked at whether skin tattoos altered a person's sweat rate. The study participants were 10 healthy men with a tattoo. According to the article, sweat was stimulated by iontophoresis using agar gel disks impregnated with 0.5\% pilocarpine nitrate. The sweat rate was determined by weighing the disk before and after sweat collection. Sweat rate was measured on both the tattooed skin and untattooed skin from the same participant. We will use these data to assess the difference in sweat rate between the tattooed and untattooed skin (tat - notat).

\subsection{Snake mazes}\label{snake-mazes}

``Sidewinding'' refers to a method of locomotion used by snakes to travel over slippery or loose terrain, such as sand. This manner of movement is a form of lateral undulation, in which an animal uses wave-like movement patterns to propel themselves forward. The desert horned viper is one of a handful of snake species that primarily uses sidewinding. As part of a recent study (Subach 2022), researchers exploring foraging behaviors of these vipers in the Sahara and western Negev deserts captured 27 unique vipers with the goal of examining how environment complexity affected movement. Each snake was placed in a circular ``maze'' of 1045 poles stuck into a sand dune (meant to simulate a dense-vegetation area). The snake was timed to see how long it took to get out of the maze. Researchers also measured how far the snake had ``traveled'' within the maze by examining the tracks left in the sand. Once the snake had completed the maze, it was allowed to travel in an open area for the same length of time as it spent in the maze; distance was again measured by the tracks in the sand. Is there evidence the distance traveled (in meters) by snakes is less in areas of dense vegetation than in open spaces, on average? Use circular maze - open area as the order of subtraction.

To simulate the null distribution of paired sample mean differences we will use a bootstrapping method. Recall that the null distribution must be created under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true. Therefore, before bootstrapping, we will need to \emph{shift} each data point by the difference \(\mu_0 - \bar{x}_d\). This will ensure that the mean of the shifted data is \(\mu_0\) (rather than the mean of the original data, \(\bar{x}_d\)), and that the simulated null distribution will be centered at the null value. This is the same process we used to create the simulation of the null distribution for a single quantitative variable.

\item
  The differences in a paired data set are treated like a single quantitative variable when performing a statistical analysis. Paired data (or paired samples) occur when pairs of measurements are collected. We are only interested in the population (and sample) of differences, and not in the original data.
\item
  When using bootstrapping to create a null distribution centered at the null value for both paired data and a single quantitative variable, we first need to shift the data by the difference \(\mu_0 - \bar{x}_d\), and then sample with replacement from the shifted data.
\item
  When analyzing paired data, the summary statistic is the `mean difference' NOT the `difference in means'\footnote{Technically, if we calculate the differences and then take the mean (mean difference), and we calculate the two means and then take the difference (difference in means), the value will be the same. However, the \emph{sampling variability} of the two statistics will differ, as we will see in Week 12.}. This terminology will be \emph{very} important in interpretations.
\item
  To create one simulated sample on the null distribution for a sample mean or mean difference, shift the original data by adding \((\mu_0 - \bar{x})\) or \((0 - \bar{x}_d)\). Sample with replacement from the shifted data \(n\) times. Calculate and plot the sample mean or the sample mean difference.
\item
  To create one simulated sample on the bootstrap distribution for a sample mean or mean difference, label \(n\) cards with the original response values. Randomly draw with replacement \(n\) times. Calculate and plot the resampled mean or the resampled mean difference.

\subsection{Color Interference}\label{color-interference}

The abstract of the article ``Studies of interference in serial verbal reactions'' in the \emph{Journal of Experimental Psychology} (Stroop 1935) reads:

\begin{quote}
In this study pairs of conflicting stimuli, both being inherent aspects of the same symbols, were presented simultaneously (a name of one color printed in the ink of another color---a word stimulus and a color stimulus).
The difference in time for reading the words printed in colors and the same words printed in black is the measure of interference of color stimuli upon reading words. \ldots{}
The interference of conflicting color stimuli upon the time for reading 100 words (each word naming a color unlike the ink-color of its print) caused an increase of 2.3 seconds or 5.6\% over the normal time for reading the same words printed in black.
\end{quote}

The article reports on the results of a study in which seventy college undergraduates were given forms with 100 names of colors written in black ink, and the same 100 names of colors written in another color (i.e., the word purple written in green ink). The total time (in seconds) for reading the 100 words printed in black, and the total time (in seconds) for reading the 100 words printed in different colors were recorded for each subject. The order in which the forms (black or color) were given was randomized to the subjects. Does printing the name of colors in a different color increase the time it takes to read the words? Use color \(-\) black as the order of subtraction.

In general, the sampling distribution for a sample mean, \(\bar{x}\), based on a sample of size \(n\) from a population with a true mean \(\mu\) and true standard deviation \(\sigma\) can be modeled using a Normal distribution when certain conditions are met.

Conditions for the sampling distribution of \(\bar{x}\) to follow an approximate Normal distribution:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Independence}: The sample's observations are independent. For paired data, that means each pairwise difference should be independent.
\item
  \textbf{Normality}: The data should be approximately normal or the sample size should be large.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    \(n < 30\): If the sample size \(n\) is less than 30 and the distribution of the data is approximately normal with no clear outliers in the data, then we typically assume the data come from a nearly normal distribution to satisfy the condition.
  \item
    \(30 \leq n < 100\): If the sample size \(n\) is betwe 30 and 100 and there are no particularly extreme outliers in the data, then we typically assume the sampling distribution of \(\bar{x}\) is nearly normal, even if the underlying distribution of individual observations is not.
  \item
    \(n \geq 100\): If the sample size \(n\) is at least 100 (regardless of the presence of skew or outliers), we typically assume the sampling distribution of \(\bar{x}\) is nearly normal, even if the underlying distribution of individual observations is not.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{11-A23-paired-theory_files/figure-latex/tdist-1} 

}

\caption{Comparison of the standard Normal vs t-distribution with various degrees of freedom}\label{fig:tdist}
\end{figure}

Like we saw in Chapter \textbf{5}, we will not know the values of the parameters and must use the sample data to estimate them. Unlike with proportions, in which we only needed to estimate the population proportion, \(\pi\), quantitative sample data must be used to estimate both a population mean \(\mu\) and a population standard deviation \(\sigma\). This additional uncertainty will require us to use a theoretical distribution that is just a bit wider than the Normal distribution. Enter the \textbf{\(t\)-distribution}!

As you can seen from Figure \ref{fig:tdist}, the \(t\)-distributions (dashed and dotted lines) are centered at 0 just like a standard Normal distribution (solid line), but are slightly wider. The variability of a \(t\)-distribution depends on its degrees of freedom, which is calculated from the sample size of a study. (For a single sample of \(n\) observations or paired differences, the degrees of freedom is equal to \(n-1\).) Recall from previous classes that larger sample sizes tend to result in narrower sampling distributions. We see that here as well. The larger the sample size, the larger the degrees of freedom, the narrower the \(t\)-distribution. (In fact, a \(t\)-distribution with infinite degrees of freedom actually IS the standard Normal distribution!)

\subsection{Swearing}\label{swearing}

Profanity (language considered obscene or taboo) and society's attitude about its acceptableness is a highly debated topic, but does swearing serve a physiological purpose or function? Previous research has shown that swearing produces increased heart rates and higher levels of skin conductivity. It is theorized that since swearing provokes intense emotional responses, it acts as a distracter, allowing a person to withstand higher levels of pain. To explore the relationship between swearing and increased pain tolerance, researchers from Keele University (Staffordshire, UK) recruited 83 native English-speaking participants (Stephens and Robertson 2020). Each volunteer performed two trials holding a hand in an ice-water bath, once while repeating the ``f-word'' every three seconds, and once while repeating a neutral word (``table''). The order of the word to repeat was randomly assigned. Researchers recorded the length of time, in seconds, from the moment the participant indicated they were in pain until they removed their hand from the ice water for each trial. They hope to find evidence that pain tolerance is greater (longer times) when a person swears compared to when they say a neutral word, on average. Use Swear -- Neutral as the order of subtraction.

Remember that the null distribution is created based on the assumption the null hypothesis is true. In this study, the null hypothesis states that swearing does not affect pain tolerance, or that the length of time a subject kept their hand in the water would be the same whether the patient was swearing or not.

We will use the \texttt{paired\_test()} function in R (in the \texttt{catstats} package) to simulate the null distribution of sample mean differences and compute a p-value.

  When using the \texttt{paired\_test()} function, we need to enter the name of the data set, either the order of subtraction (if the data set has both measurements) or the name of the differences (if the data set contains them). We will also need to provide R with the observed mean difference, the direction of the alternative hypothesis, and the shift required in order to force the null hypothesis to be true. The name of the data set as shown above is \texttt{swearing\_diff} and the column of differences is called \texttt{differences}.

  \item

  \item
    \textbf{Large enough sample size: Normality Condition}: The sample observations come from a normally distributed population. Need to check for each group by using the following rules of thumb:

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      \(n < 30\): Each distribution of the sample must be approximately normal with no outliers
    \item
      \(30 \ge n < 100\): We can relax the condition a little; the distribution of each sample must have no extreme outliers or skewness
    \item
      \(n > 100\): Can assume the sampling distribution of \(\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2\) is nearly normal, even if the underlying distribuion of individual observations is not
    \end{itemize}

  In this module, we will study inference for a \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ explanatory variable and a \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ response variable where the two groups are \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.
\item
  Independent groups: When the measurements in one sample are not
  related to the measurements in the other sample.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Two random samples taken separately from two populations and the same response variable is recorded. Compare the average number of sick days off from work for people who had a flu shot and people who didn't.
\item
  Participants are randomly assigned to one of two treatment conditions, and the same response variable is recorded.
\end{itemize}

Rather than analyzing the differences as a single mean we will calculate summary statistics on each sample.

Example: Fifty-one (51) college students volunteered to look at impacts on memorization, specifically if putting letters into recognizable patterns (like FBI, CIA, EDA, CDC, etc.) would increase the number letters memorized. (Miller 1956) The college students were randomly assigned to either a recognizable or non-recognizable letter group. After a period of study time, the number of letters memorized was collected on each study. Is there evidence that putting letters into recognizable letter groups improve memory?

Example: Every year, orange and black monarch butterflies migrate from their summer breeding grounds in the US and Canada to mountain forests in central Mexico, where they hibernate for the winter. Due to abnormal weather patterns and drought affecting monarch habitats and feeding grounds, the population of monarch butterflies is estimated to have decreased by 53\% from the 2018-2019 wintering season to the 2019-2020 wintering season (WWF, 2020). While conservationists often resort to captive-rearing with the goal of raising biologically indistinct individuals for release into the wild, tagging studies have shown that captive-reared monarchs have lower migratory success compared to wild monarchs. For this study, the researchers raised 67 monarchs (descended from wild monarchs) from eggs to maturity and then compared them to a group of 40 wild-caught monarchs. The researchers want to explore whether the maximum grip strength (how many Newtons a butterfly exerts at the moment of release when gently tugged from a mesh-covered perch) differs between captive-reared and wild-caught monarchs. Use Captive -- Wild for order of subtraction.

\subsection{Behavior and Performance}\label{behavior-and-performance}

A study in the Academy of Management Journal (Porath 2017) investigated how rude behaviors influence a victim's task performance. Randomly selected college students enrolled in a management course were randomly assigned to one of two experimental conditions: rudeness condition (45 students) and control group (53 students). Each student was asked to write down as many uses for a brick as possible in five minutes; this value (total number of uses) was used as a performance measure for each student, where higher values indicate better performance. During this time another individual showed up late for class. For those students in the rudeness condition, the facilitator displayed rudeness by berating the students in general for being irresponsible and unprofessional (due to the late-arriving person). No comments were made about the late-arriving person for students in the control group. Is there evidence that the average performance score for students in the rudeness condition is lower than for students in the control group? Use the order of subtraction of rudeness -- control.

\subsection{Terminology review}\label{terminology-review-22}

In today's activity, we will use theory-based methods to analyze the association between one categorical explanatory variable and one quantitative response variable, where the groups formed by the categorical variable are independent. Some terms covered in this activity are:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Difference in means
\item
  Independence within and between groups
\item
  Normality
\end{itemize}

To review these concepts, see Chapter 19 in the textbook.

\subsection{Moon Phases and Virtual Reality}\label{moon-phases-and-virtual-reality}

In a study comparing immersive virtual reality (VR) to traditional hands-on methods, researchers recruited 115 undergraduate students to assess the effectiveness of these approaches in teaching complex scientific concepts like Moon phases (Madden 2020). Participants were randomly assigned to experience either a VR simulation replicating the Sun-Earth-Moon system or a hands-on activity where they physically manipulated models to observe Moon phases. The students were given a 14 multiple choice question quiz about Moon phases and the Moon's motion relative to the Earth to evaluate their understanding of Moon phases and the Moon's motion. Each question had only one correct answer, and the participant's score was the sum of the number of correct answers, with all questions weighted equally (with a maximum score of 14). Is there evidence of a difference, on average, in student learning comparing those using VR methods to those using the traditional method? Use order of subtraction VR -- Hands-on.

The sampling distribution for \(\bar{x}_1-\bar{x}_2\) can be modeled using a normal distribution when certain conditions are met.

Conditions for the sampling distribution of \(\bar{x}_1-\bar{x}_2\) to follow an approximate normal distribution:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Independence}: The sample's observations are independent
\item
  \textbf{Normality}: Each sample should be approximately normal or have a large sample size. For \emph{each} sample:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    \(n < 30\): If the sample size \(n\) is less than 30 and there are no clear outliers in the data, then we typically assume the data come from a nearly normal distribution to satisfy the condition.
  \item
    \(30 \le n < 100\): If the sample size \(n\) is between 30 and 100 and there are no particularly extreme outliers, then we typically assume the sampling distribution of \(\bar{x}\) is nearly normal, even if the underlying distribution of individual observations is not.
  \item
    \(n \geq 100\): If the sample size \(n\) is at least 100 (regardless of the presence of skew or outliers), we typically assume the sampling distribution of \(\bar{x}\) is nearly normal, even if the underlying distribution of individual observations is not.

\subsection{Trustworthiness}\label{trustworthiness}

Researchers in India wanted to find out how trustworthy famous YouTubers are (Kalra 2022). They went through a process in which they collected data on many videos from famous YouTubers to determine a trustworthiness score. Scientists randomly selected videos from famous YouTubers (\textgreater1000 subscribers) to include in the study. There were many different factors that went into calculating the trustworthiness score. Researchers also recorded if YouTubers were a subject matter expert (SME) or not a subject matter expert (non-SME). An example of an SME would be if one of your statistics professors made a YouTube video of how to do hypothesis testing. An example of someone who isn't an SME would be if one of your friends who has never taken a civil engineering class in their life decided to make a YouTube video about how to build a bridge. There were 621 Youtubers who are SMEs in the sample and 1026 who aren't SMEs. Is there evidence of a difference in mean trustworthiness score between subject matter experts (SME) YouTubers and non-SME YouTubers? Use SME -- Non -SME as the order of subtraction

\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Conditions necessary to use theory-based methods}

When performing inference on a least squares line, the follow conditions are generally required:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{Independent observations} (for both simulation-based and theory-based methods): individual data points must be independent.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Check this assumption by investigating the sampling method and determining if the observational units are related in any way.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \emph{Linearity} (for both simulation-based and theory-based methods): the data should follow a linear trend.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Check this assumption by examining the scatterplot of the two variables, and a scatterplot of the residuals (on the \(y\)-axis) versus the fitted values (on the \(x\)-axis). The pattern in the residual plot should display a horizontal line.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \emph{Constant variability} (for theory-based methods only): the variability of points around the least squares line remains roughly constant

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Check this assumption by examining a scatterplot of the residuals (on the \(y\)-axis) versus the fitted values (on the \(x\)-axis). The variability in the residuals around zero should be approximately the same for all fitted values.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \emph{Nearly normal residuals} (for theory-based methods only: residuals must be nearly normal.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Check this assumption by examining a histogram of the residuals, which should appear approximately normal.

Example: Data were collected from 1236 births between 1960 and 1967 in the San Francisco East Bay area to better understand what variables contributed to child birthweight, as children with low birthweight often suffer from an array of complications later in life ({``Child Health and Development Studies,''} n.d.). There were some missing values in the study and with those observations removed we have a total of 1223 births.

Here you see a glimpse of the data. The 1223 rows correspond to the sample size. The case variable is labeling each pregnancy 1 through 1223. Then 7 variables are recorded. birthweight (bwt), length of gestation in days, parity is called an indicator variable telling us if the pregnancy was a first pregnancy (labeled as 0) or not (labeled as 1) were recorded about the child and pregnancy. The age, height, and weight were recorded for the mother giving birth, as was smoke, another indicator variable where 0 means the mother did not smoke during pregnancy, and 1 indicates that she did smoke while pregnant.

  Form: linear or non-linear?
\item
  Direction: positive or negative?
\item
  Strength: how clear is the pattern between the two variables?
\item
  Outliers: points that are far from the pattern or bulk of the data

Example: Oceanic temperature is important for sea life. The California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations has measured several variables on the Pacific Ocean for more than 70 years hoping to better understand weather patterns and impacts on ocean life. ({``Ocean Temperature and Salinity Study,''} n.d.) For this example, we will look at the most recent 100 measurements of salt water salinity (measured in PSUs or practical salinity units) and the temperature of the ocean measured in degrees Celsius. Is there evidence that water temperature in the Pacific Ocean tends to decrease with higher levels of salinity?

\subsection{Moneyball}\label{moneyball}

The goal of a Major League baseball team is to make the playoffs. In 2002, the manager of the Oakland A's, Billy Bean, with the help of Paul DePodesta began to use statistics to determine which players to choose for their season. Based on past data, DePodesta determined that to make it to the playoffs, the A's would need to win at least 95 games in the regular season. In order to win more games, they would need to score more runs than they allowed. The Oakland A's won 20 consecutive games and a total of 103 games for the season. The success of this use of sports analytics was portrayed by the 2011 movie, Moneyball. In this study, we will see if there is evidence of a positive linear relationship between the difference in the number of runs scored minus the number of runs allowed (\texttt{RD}) and the number of wins for Major League baseball teams in the years before 2002. Some of the variables collected in the data set baseball consist of the following:

\subsubsection*{Coefficient of determination (squared correlation)}\label{coefficient-of-determination-squared-correlation}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Coefficient of determination (squared correlation)}

Another summary measure used to explain the linear relationship between two quantitative variables is the coefficient of determination (\(r^2\)). The coefficient of determination, \(r^2\), can also be used to describe the strength of the linear relationship between two quantitative variables. The value of \(r^2\) (a value between 0 and 1) represents the \textbf{proportion of variation in the response that is explained by the least squares line with the explanatory variable}. There are two ways to calculate the coefficient of determination:

~~~Square the correlation coefficient: \(r^2 = (r)^2\)

~~~Use the variances of the response and the residuals: \(r^2 = \dfrac{s_y^2 - s_{RES}^2}{s_y^2} = \dfrac{SST - SSE}{SST}\)

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{5}
\tightlist
\item
  Use the correlation, \(r\), found in question 5, to calculate the coefficient of determination between SATMath\_75 and Retention, \(r^2\).
\end{enumerate}

\vspace{.4in}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{6}
\tightlist
\item
  The variance of the response variable, Retention in \$MM, is \(s_{Retention}^2 = 138.386\) \(\%^2\) and the variability in the residuals is \(s_{RES}^2 = 56.934\) \%\(^2\). Use these values to calculate the coefficient of determination.
\end{enumerate}

\vspace{1in}

In the next part of the activity we will explore what the coefficient of determination measures.

In the first scatterplot, we see the data plotted with a horizontal line. Note that the regression line in this plot has a slope of zero; this assumes there is no relationship between SATMath\_75 and Retention. The value of the y-intercept, 76.387, is the mean of the response variable when there is no relationship between the two variables. To find the sum of squares total (SST) we find the residual (\(residual = y - \hat{y}\)) for each response value from the horizontal line (from the value of 76.387). Each residual is squared and the sum of the squared values is calculated. The SST gives the \textbf{total variability in the response variable, Retention}.

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{13-A27-EDA-two-quantitative-corr_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-5-1} \end{center}

The calculated value for the SST is 158451.8.

This next scatterplot, shows the plotted data with the best fit regression line. This is the line of best fit between budget and revenue and has the smallest sum of squares error (SSE). The SSE is calculated by finding the residual from each response value to the regression line. Each residual is squared and the sum of the squared values is calculated.

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{13-A27-EDA-two-quantitative-corr_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-6-1} \end{center}

The calculated value for the SSE is 65133.022.

\item
  The sign of correlation and the sign of the slope will always be the same. The closer the value of correlation is to \(-1\) or \(+1\), the stronger the linear relationship between the explanatory and the response variable.
\item
  The coefficient of determination multiplied by 100 (\(r^2 \times 100\)) measures the percent of variation in the response variable that is explained by the relationship with the explanatory variable. The closer the value of the coefficient of determination is to 100\%, the stronger the relationship.
\item
  We can use the line of regression to predict values of the response variable for values of the explanatory variable. Do not use values of the explanatory variable that are outside of the range of values in the data set to predict values of the response variable (reflect on why this is true.). This is called \textbf{extrapolation}.

\subsection{Crocodilian Body Size}\label{crocodilian-body-size}

Much research surrounds using measurements of animals to estimate body-size of extinct animals. Many challenges exist in making accurate estimates for extinct crocodilians. The term crocodilians refers to all members of the family Crocodylidae (``true'' crocodiles), family Alligatoridae (alligators and caimans) and family Gavialidae (gharial, Tomistoma). The researchers in this study (O'Brien 2019) state, ``Among extinct crocodilians and their precursors (e.g., suchians), several methods have been developed to predict body size from suites of hard-tissue proxies. Nevertheless, many have limited applications due to the disparity of some major suchian groups and biases in the fossil record. Here, we test the utility of head width (HW) as a broadly applicable body-size estimator in living and fossil suchians.'' Data were collected on 76 male and female individuals of different species. Is there evidence that head width (measured in cm) is a good predictor of total body length (measured in cm) for crocodilians?

\subsubsection*{Simulation-based hypothesis test}\label{simulation-based-hypothesis-test}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Simulation-based hypothesis test}

Let's start by thinking about how one simulation would be created on the null distribution using cards. First, we would write the values for the response variable, total length, on each card. Next, we would shuffle these \(y\) values while keeping the \(x\) values (explanatory variable) in the same order. Then, find the line of regression for the shuffled \((x, y)\) pairs and calculate either the slope or correlation of the shuffled sample.

We will use the \texttt{regression\_test()} function in R (in the \texttt{catstats} package) to simulate the null distribution of shuffled slopes (or shuffled correlations) and compute a p-value. We will need to enter the response variable name and the explanatory variable name for the formula, the data set name (identified above as \texttt{croc}), the summary measure for the test (either slope or correlation), number of repetitions, the sample statistic (value of slope or correlation), and the direction of the alternative hypothesis.

The response variable name is \texttt{TL\_cm} and the explanatory variable name is \texttt{HW\_cm} for these data.

\subsection{Golf driving distance}\label{golf-driving-distance}

In golf the goal is to complete a hole with as few strokes as possible. A long driving distance to start a hole can help minimize the strokes necessary to complete the hole, as long as that drive stays on the fairway. Data were collected on 354 PGA and LPGA players in 2008 ({``Average Driving Distance and Fairway Accuracy''} 2008). For each player, the average driving distance (yards), fairway accuracy (percentage), and sex was measured. Use these data to assess, ``Does a professional golfer give up accuracy when they hit the ball farther?''

\subsubsection*{Conditions for the least squares line}\label{conditions-for-the-least-squares-line}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Conditions for the least squares line}

When performing inference on a least squares line, the follow conditions are generally required:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{Independent observations} (for both simulation-based and theory-based methods): individual data points must be independent.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Check this assumption by investigating the sampling method and determining if the observational units are related in any way.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \emph{Linearity} (for both simulation-based and theory-based methods): the data should follow a linear trend.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Check this assumption by examining the scatterplot of the two variables, and a scatterplot of the residuals (on the \(y\)-axis) versus the fitted values (on the \(x\)-axis). The pattern in the residual plot should display a horizontal line.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \emph{Constant variability} (for theory-based methods only): the variability of points around the least squares line remains roughly constant

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Check this assumption by examining a scatterplot of the residuals (on the \(y\)-axis) versus the fitted values (on the \(x\)-axis). The variability in the residuals around zero should be approximately the same for all fitted values.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \emph{Nearly normal residuals} (for theory-based methods only: residuals must be nearly normal.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Check this assumption by examining a histogram of the residuals, which should appear approximately normal.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

The scatterplot generated earlier and the residual plots shown below will be used to assess these conditions for approximating the data with the \(t\)-distribution.

Recall that a confidence interval is calculated by adding and subtracting the margin of error to the point estimate.\\
\[\mbox{point estimate}\pm t^*\times SE(\mbox{estimate}).\]
When the point estimate is a regression slope, this formula becomes
\[b_1 \pm t^* \times SE(b_1).\]

The \(t^*\) multiplier comes from a \(t\)-distribution with \(n-2\) degrees of freedom. The sample size for this study is 354 so we will use the degrees of freedom 352 (\(n-2\)).

\subsection{Take-home messages}\label{take-home-messages-26}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  To check the validity conditions for using theory-based methods we must use the residual diagnostic plots to check for normality of residuals and constant variability, and the scatterplot to check for linearity.
\item
  To interpret a confidence interval for the slope, think about how to interpret the sample slope and use that information in the confidence interval interpretation for slope.
\item
  Use the explanatory variable row in the linear model R output to obtain the slope estimate (\texttt{estimate} column) and standard error of the slope (\texttt{Std.\ Error} column) to calculate the standardized slope, or T-score. The calculated T-score should match the \texttt{t\ value} column in the explanatory variable row. The standardized slope tells the number of standard errors the observed slope is above or below 0.
\item
  The explanatory variable row in the linear model R output provides a \textbf{two-sided} p-value under the \texttt{Pr(\textgreater{}\textbar{}t\textbar{})} column.
\item
  The standardized slope is compared to a \(t\)-distribution with \(n-2\) degrees of freedom in order to obtain a p-value. The \(t\)-distribution with \(n-2\) degrees of freedom is also used to find the appropriate multiplier for a given confidence level.

\subsection{Big Mac Index}\label{big-mac-index}

Can the relative cost of a Big Mac across different countries be used to predict the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per person for that country? The log GDP per person and the adjusted dollar equivalent to purchase a Big Mac was found on a random sample of 55 countries in January of 2022. The cost of a Big Mac in each country was adjusted to US dollars based on current exchange rates. Is there evidence of a positive relationship between Big Mac cost (\texttt{dollar\_price}) and the log GDP per person (\texttt{log\_GDP})?

\section{Module 11 Review - Paired Data}\label{module-11-review---paired-data}

Students in an introductory statistics class were asked to participate in an experiment to answer this question. Each student flipped a coin to determine which exercise to complete first. If the coin landed on heads the student would do jumping jacks for 30 seconds and then measure their heart rate in beats per minute (bpm). After a 2 minute break the student would do bicycle kicks for 30 seconds and then record their heart rate. If the coin landed on tails the student would complete bicycle kicks first followed by jumping jacks using the same times as above. For this study we will use the order of subtraction jumping jacks -- bicycle kicks. Which exercise, jumping jacks or bicycle kicks will raise your heart rate more?

\begin{verbatim}
#>   min Q1 median Q3 max     mean       sd  n missing

Next we will use theory-based methods.

The sampling distribution for \(\bar{x}\) based on a sample of size \(n\) from a population with a true mean \(\mu\) and true standard deviation \(\sigma\) can be modeled using a normal distribution when certain conditions are met.

Conditions for the sampling distribution of \(\bar{x}\) to follow an approximate normal distribution:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Independence}: The sample's observations are independent
\item
  \textbf{Normality}: The data should be approximately normal or the sample size should be large.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    \(n < 30\): If the sample size \(n\) is less than 30 and there are no clear outliers in the distribution of differences, then we typically assume the data come from a nearly normal distribution to satisfy the condition.
  \item
    \(30 \le n < 100\): If the sample size \(n\) is between 30 and 100 and there are no particularly extreme outliers in the differences of differences, then we typically assume the sampling distribution of \(\bar{x}\) is nearly normal to satisfy the condition
  \item
    \(n \ge 100\): If the sample size is greater than 100 then we typically assume the sampling distribution of \(\bar{x}\) is nearly normal to satisfy the condition, even if the underlying distribution of individual observations is not.
  \end{itemize}

\item
  Are the conditions met to model the data with theory-based methods?

\vspace{0.8in}

To find the standardized statistic for the paired differences we will use the following formula:

\[T = \frac{\bar{x}_d - \text{null value}}{SE(\bar{x}_d)},\]

where the standard error of the sample mean difference is:

\[SE(\bar{x}_d)=\frac{s_d}{\sqrt{n}}.\]

To calculate the 95\% theory-based confidence interval for the paired mean difference, use the following formula:

We will need to find the \(t^*\) multiplier using the function \texttt{qt()}. For a 95\% confidence level, we are finding the \(t^*\) value at the 97.5th percentile with \texttt{df} = \(n_d - 1 = 42 - 1 = 41\).

\section{Module 12 Review - Independent Samples}\label{module-12-review---independent-samples}

The ``social brain hypothesis,'' or the ``social intelligence hypothesis,'' suggests that living in socially cohesive groups with differentiated relationships requires a higher cognitive load, in turn resulting in higher brain volume. There is evidence this hypothesis holds for primates and some other mammal groups, but it hasn't been explored in birds, as most birds typically have temporary social groupings that lack clear relationships. However, woodpeckers have a wide range of clearly differing social relationships while also having the benefit of being physiologically and environmentally similar across species. Researchers want to know if the ``social brain hypothesis'' holds true for woodpeckers: is the average brain volume (in mm\^{}3) smaller for woodpeckers that tend to be solitary compared to woodpeckers that tend to live in pairs or groups? For the purpose of this study, ``solitary'' birds are classified as those that only pair-bond to breed, and otherwise are solitary for more than half a year each year. ``Group-living'' birds are those that spend more than half the year in communal groups or flocks. Researchers examined 61 species of woodpeckers. Use solitary - group living as the order of subtraction

\section{Module 13 Review - Regression}\label{module-13-review---regression}

Spotify created a list of the top songs around the world for the past 10 years and several different audio features of those songs. Among the variables measured on these songs, we will look at the relationship between Valance and Danceability. Valance measures the positive mood of a song; the higher the point value the more positive the mood of the song. Danceability measures how easy it is to dance to a song; the higher the point value the easier it is to dance to the song.

When performing inference on a least squares line, the follow conditions are generally required

  Linearity: the data should follow a linear trend
\item
  Nearly normal residuals: residuals must be nearly normal
\item
  Constant variability: the variability of points around the least squares line remains roughly constant
\item
  Independent observations: individual data points must be independent
\end{itemize}

The scatterplot and the residual plots will be used to assess the conditions for approximating the data with the \(t\)-distribution.

The \(t^*\) multiplier comes from the \(t\)-distribution with \(n-2\) df. Recall for a 99\% confidence interval, use the 99.5\% percentile (99\% of the distribution is in the middle, leaving 0.5\% in each tail). The sample size is 603 so the df is 601.

\section{Group Final Exam Review}\label{group-final-exam-review}

\setstretch{1}

Use the provided data set from the Islands (Bulmer, n.d.) (FinalExamReviewData.csv) and the appropriate Exam Review R script file to answer the following questions. Each adult (\textgreater21) islander was selected at random from all adult islanders. Note that some islanders choose not to participate in the study. These islanders that did not consent to be in the study are removed from the dataset before analysis. Variables and their descriptions are listed below. Here is some more information about some of the variables collected. Music type (classical or heavy metal) was randomly assigned to the Islanders. Time to complete the puzzle cube was measured after listening to music for each Islander. Heart rate and blood glucose levels were both measured before and then after drinking a caffeinated beverage.

\section{Golden Ticket to Descriptive and Inferential Statistical Methods}\label{golden-ticket-to-descriptive-and-inferential-statistical-methods}

In this course, we have covered descriptive (summary statistics and plots) and inferential (hypothesis tests and confidence intervals) methods for five different scenarios:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  one categorical response variable
\item
  two categorical variables
\item
  one quantitative response variable or paired differences in a quantitative variable
\item
  two quantitative variables
\item
  one quantitative response variable and one categorical explanatory variable
\end{itemize}

The ``golden ticket'' shown on the next page presents a visual summary of the similarities and differences across these five scenarios.
