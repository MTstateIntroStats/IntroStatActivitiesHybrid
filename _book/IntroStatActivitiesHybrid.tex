This coursepack accompanies the textbook for STAT 216: Introduction to Statistics at Montana State University, which can be found at \url{https://mtstateintrostats.github.io/IntroStatTextbook/}. The syllabus for the course (including the course calendar), data sets, and links to D2L Brightspace, Gradescope, and the MSU RStudio server can be found on the course webpage: \url{https://math.montana.edu/courses/s216/}.
Other notes and review materials are linked in D2L.

Each of the activities in this workbook is designed to target specific learning outcomes of the course, giving you practice with important statistical concepts in a group setting with instructor guidance. In addition to the in-class activities for the course, the coursepack includes reading guides to aid in taking notes while you complete the required readings and videos. Bring this workbook with you to class each class period, and take notes in the workbook as you would your own notes. A well-written completed workbook will provide an optimal study guide for exams!

The out of class activities will be completed outside of class, typically between the Monday and Wednesday classes. The additional activities and labs in this coursepack will be completed during class time. Parts of each lab will be turned in on Gradescope. To aid in your understanding, read through the introduction for each activity before attending class each day.

STAT 216 is a 3-credit in-person course. In our experience, it takes six to nine hours per week outside of class to achieve a good grade in this class. By ``good'' we mean at least a C because a grade of D or below does not count toward fulfilling degree requirements. Many of you set your goals higher than just getting a C, and we fully support that. You need roughly nine hours per week to review past activities, read feedback on previous assignments, complete current assignments, and prepare for the next day's class. A typical week in the life of a STAT 216 student looks like:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{Prior to class meeting}:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Read assigned sections of the textbook, using the provided reading guides to take notes on the material.
  \item
    Read through the introduction to the day's in-class activity
  \item
    Read through the week's homework assignment and note any questions you may have on the content.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \emph{During class meeting}:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Work through the in-class activity or weekly lab with your classmates and instructor, taking detailed notes on your answers to each question in the activity.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \emph{After class meeting}:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Complete any parts of the activity you did not complete in class.
  \item
    Review the activity solutions in the Math and Stat Center, and take notes on key points.
  \item
    Complete any remaining assigned readings for the week.
  \item
    Complete the week's homework assignment.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Big Idea: Variability is inevitable! We would not expect to get \emph{exactly} 50 heads in 100 coin flips. The statistical question then is whether any differences found in data are due to random variability, or if something else is going on.

\begin{quote}
The larger the difference, the \textbf{less we believe the difference was due to chance.}
\end{quote}

In a data frame, rows correspond to \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

and columns correspond to \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

How many types of variables are discussed? Explain the differences between them and give an example of each.
\rgs
\rgs

True or False: A pair of variables can be both associated AND independent.\\
True or False: Given a pair of variables, one will always be the explanatory variable and one the response variable.\\
True or False: If a study does have an explanatory and a response variable, that means changes in the explanatory variable must \textbf{cause} changes in the response variable.

True or False: Observational studies can show a naturally occurring association between variables.

True or False: Convenience sampling tends to result in non-response bias.

True or False: Volunteer sampling tends to result in response bias.

Statistics is the study of how best to collect, analyze, and draw conclusions from data. Today in class you will be introduced to the following terms:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Observational units or cases
\item
  Variables: categorical or quantitative
\end{itemize}

Information is provided throughout each activity and lab to guide students through that day's activity or lab. Be sure to read ALL the material provided at the beginning of the activity and between each question. At the end of each activity is a section called \emph{Take-home messages} that contains key points from the day's activity. Use these to review the day's activity and make sure you have a full understanding of that material.

\hypertarget{steps-of-the-statistical-investigation-process}{%
\subsection{Steps of the statistical investigation process}\label{steps-of-the-statistical-investigation-process}}

As we move through the semester we will work through the six steps of the statistical investigation process.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Ask a research question.
\item
  Design a study and collect data.
\item
  Summarize and visualize the data. \emph{Weeks 3--4}
\item
  Use statistical analysis methods to draw inferences from the data. \emph{Weeks 6--13}
\item
  Communicate the results and answer the research question. \emph{Weeks 6--13}
\item
  Revisit and look forward.
\end{enumerate}

Today we will focus on the first two steps.

\textbf{Step 1}: The first step of any statistical investigation is to \emph{ask a research question}. As stated in the textbook, ``with the rise of data science, however, we might not start with a research question, and instead start with a data set.'' Today we will create a data set by collecting responses on students in class.

\textbf{Step 2}: To answer any research question, we must \emph{design a study and collect data}. Our study will consist of answers from each student. Your responses will become our observed data that we will explore.

\textbf{Observational units} or \textbf{cases} are the subjects data are collected on. In a spreadsheet of the data set, each row will represent a single observational unit.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}

A \textbf{variable} is information collected or measured on each observational unit or case. Each column in a data set will represent a different variable. The rows in a data set represent the observational units.

We will look at two types of variables: \textbf{quantitative} and \textbf{categorical} (see Figure \ref{fig:types-of-variables}).

Quantitative variables are numerical measurements that can be discrete (whole, non-negative numbers) or continuous (any value within an interval). The number of pets one owns would be a discrete variable as you can not have a partial pet. GPA would be a continuous variable ranging from 0 to 4.0.

The outcome of a categorical variable is a group or category such as eye color, state of residency, or whether or not a student lives on campus. Categorical variables with a natural ordering are considered ordinal variables while those without a natural ordering are considered nominal variables. All categorical variables will be treated as nominal for analysis in this course.

When creating a data set for use in R it is important to use single words or an underscore between words. Each outcome must be written the same way each time. Make sure to use all lowercase letters to create this data set to have consistency between responses. Do not give units of measure with the numerical values for the length of forearm.

  The header for each column describes each variable measured on the observational unit. When writing a variable we need to specify what we are measuring. For example, the column header \texttt{Residency} in our data set represents the variable \emph{whether a student has in-state or out-of-state residency} not \emph{what state a student is from}. For each column of data, fill in the following table to write out the variable we are collecting on each observational unit in this study and the type of each variable.

True or False: Observational studies can show an association between two variables, but cannot determine a causal relationship.

True or False: In order for an experiment to be valid, a placebo must be used.

True or False: If random sampling of the target population is used, and no other types of bias are suspected, results from the sample can be generalized to the entire target population.

True or False: If random sampling of the target population is used, and no other types of bias are suspected, results from the sample can be inferred as a causal relationship between the explanatory and response variables.

Example: Newspaper article from 1936 reported that Landon won the presidential election over Roosevelt based on a poll of 10 million voters. Roosevelt was the actual winner. What was wrong with this poll? Poll was completed using a telephone survey and not all people in 1936 had a telephone. Only a certain subset of the population owned a telephone so this subset was over-represented in the telephone survey. The results of the study, showing that Landon would win, did not represent the target population of all US voters.

Example: It is well known that humans have more difficulty differentiating between faces of people from different races than people within their own race. A 2018 study published in the Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance investigated a similar phenomenon with gender. In the study, volunteers were shown several pictures of strangers. Half the volunteers were randomly assigned to rate the attractiveness of the individuals pictured. The other half were told to rate the distinctiveness of the faces seen. Both groups were then shown a slideshow of faces (some that had been rated in the first part of the study, some that were new to the volunteer) and asked to determine if each face was old or new. Researchers found people were better able to recognize faces of their own gender when asked to rate the distinctiveness of the faces, compared to when asked to rate the attractiveness of the faces.

Complete questions 1 - 4 in class on Monday. Your instructor will create and post the distribution needed for the remainder of the activity by 8 pm on Monday night. For this activity, you will read a speech given by Jim Becenti, a member of the Navajo American Indian tribe, who spoke about the employment problems his people faced at an Office of Indian Affairs meeting in Phoenix, Arizona, on January 30, 1947 (Moquin and Van Doren 1973). His speech is below:

\textbf{It is hard for us to go outside the reservation where we meet strangers. I have been off the reservation ever since I was sixteen. Today I am sorry I quit the Santa Fe {[}Railroad{]}. I worked for them in 1912-13. You are enjoying life, liberty, and happiness on the soil the American Indian had, so it is your responsibility to give us a hand, brother. Take us out of distress. I have never been to vocational school. I have very little education. I look at the white man who is a skilled laborer. When I was a young man I worked for a man in Gallup as a carpenter's helper. He treated me as his own brother. I used his tools. Then he took his tools and gave me a list of tools I should buy and I started carpentering just from what I had seen. We have no alphabetical language.}

\textbf{We see things with our eyes and can always remember it. I urge that we help my people to progress in skilled labor as well as common labor. The hope of my people is to change our ways and means in certain directions, so they can help you someday as taxpayers. If not, as you are going now, you will be burdened the rest of your life. The hope of my people is that you will continue to help so that we will be all over the United States and have a hand with you, and give us a brotherly hand so we will be happy as you are. Our reservation is awful small. We did not know the capacity of the range until the white man come and say ``you raise too much sheep, got to go somewhere else,'' resulting in reduction to a skeleton where the Indians can't make a living on it. For eighty years we have been confused by the general public, and what is the condition of the Navajo today? Starvation! We are starving for education. Education is the main thing and the only thing that is going to make us able to compete with you great men here talking to us.}

Today we will return to the American Indian Address introduced in the out of class activity. Suppose instead of attempting to select a representative sample by eye (which did not work), each student used a random number generator to select a simple random sample of 10 words. A \textbf{simple random sample} relies on a random mechanism to choose a sample, without replacement, from the population, such that every sample of size 10 is equally likely to be chosen.

To use a random number generator to select a simple random sample, you first need a numbered list of all the words in the population, called a \textbf{sampling frame}. You can then generate 10 random numbers from the numbers 1 to 359 (the number of words in the population), and the chosen random numbers correspond to the chosen words in your sample.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Use the random number generator at \url{https://istats.shinyapps.io/RandomNumbers/} to select a simple random sample from the population of all 359 words in the speech.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Set ``Choose Minimum'' to 1 and ``Choose Maximum'' to 359 to represent the 359 words in the population (the sampling frame).
\item
  Set ``How many numbers do you want to generate?'' to 10 and ensure the ``No'' option is selected under ``Sample with Replacement?''
\item
  Click ``Generate''.
\end{itemize}

Atrial fibrillation is an irregular and often elevated heart rate. In some people, atrial fibrillation will come and go on its own, but others will experience this condition on a permanent basis. When atrial fibrillation is constant, medications are required to stabilize the patient's heart rate and to help prevent blood clots from forming. Pharmaceutical scientists at a large pharmaceutical company believe they have developed a new medication that effectively stabilizes heart rates in people with permanent atrial fibrillation. They set out to conduct a trial study to investigate the new drug. The scientists will need to compare the proportion of patients whose heart rate is stabilized between two groups of subjects, one of whom is given a placebo and the other given the new medication.

While the strategy presented in question 5 controlled for the sex of the subject, there are more potential \textbf{confounding variables} in the study. A confounding variable is a variable that is \emph{both}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  associated with the explanatory variable, \emph{and}
\item
  associated with the response variable.
\end{enumerate}

When both these conditions are met, if we observe an association between the explanatory variable and the response variable in the data, we cannot be sure if this association is due to the explanatory variable or the confounding variable---the explanatory and confounding variables are ``confounded.''

\textbf{Random assignment} means that subjects in a study have an equally likely chance of receiving any of the available treatments.

  Navigate to the ``Randomizing Subjects'' applet under the ``Other Applets'' heading at: \url{http://www.rossmanchance.com/ISIapplets.html}. This applet lists the sex and height of each of the 24 subjects. Click ``Show Graphs'' to see a bar chart showing the sex of each subject. Currently, the applet is showing the strategy outlined in question 3.

~~~What is the difference in proportion of males between the two groups (placebo - drug)?

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{6}
\item
  Notice the difference in the two proportions is shown as a dot in the plot at the bottom of the web page. Un-check the box for Animate above ``Randomize'' and click ``Randomize'' again. Did you get the same difference in proportion of males between the placebo and drug groups?
  \vspace{0.25in}
\item
  Change ``Replications'' to 998 (for 1000 total). Click ``Randomize'' again. Sketch the plot of the distribution of difference in proportions from each of the 1000 random assignments here. Be sure to include a descriptive \(x\)-axis label.
  \vspace{1.25in}
\item
  \textbf{Does random assignment \emph{always} balance the placebo and drug groups based on the sex of the participants? Does random assignment \emph{tend} to make the placebo and drug groups \emph{roughly} the same with respect to the distribution of sex? Use your plot from question 8 to justify your answers.}
  \vspace{0.5in}
\item
  Change the drop-down menu below Group 2 from ``sex'' to ``height''. The applet now calculates the average height in the placebo and drug groups for each of the 1000 random assignments. The dot plot displays the distribution of the difference in mean heights (placebo - drug) for each random assignment. Based on this dot plot, is height distributed equally, on average, between the two groups? Explain how you know.

The diagram below summarizes these ideas about confounding variables and random assignment. When a confounding variable is present (such as sex or height), and an association is found in a study, it is impossible to discern what caused the change in the response variable. Is the change the result of the explanatory variable or the confounding variable? However, if all confounding variables are \emph{balanced} across the treatment groups, then only the explanatory variable differs between the groups and thus \emph{must have caused} the change seen in the response variable.

The two main study designs we will cover are \textbf{observational studies} and \textbf{experiments}. In observational studies, researchers have no influence over which subjects are in each group being compared (though they can control other variables in the study). An experiment is defined by assignment of the treatment groups of the \emph{explanatory variable}, typically via random assignment.

For the next exercises identify the study design (observational study or experiment), the sampling method, and the scope of inference.

  The pharmaceutical company Moderna Therapeutics, working in conjunction with the National Institutes of Health, conducted Phase 3 clinical trials of a vaccine for COVID-19 last fall. US clinical research sites enrolled 30,000 volunteers without COVID-19 to participate. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either the candidate vaccine or a saline placebo. They were then followed to assess whether or not they developed COVID-19. The trial was double-blind, so neither the investigators nor the participants knew who was assigned to which group.

\item
  The study design (observational study vs, experiment) determines if we can draw causal inferences or not. If an association is detected, a randomized experiment allows us to conclude that there is a causal (cause-and-effect) relationship between the explanatory and response variable. Observational studies have potential confounding variables within the study that prevent us from inferring a causal relationship between the variables studied.
\item
  Confounding variables are variables not included in the study that are related to both the explanatory and the response variables. When there are potential confounding variables in the study we cannot draw causal inferences.
\item
  Random assignment balances confounding variables across treatment groups. This eliminates any possible confounding variables by breaking the connections between the explanatory variable and the potential confounding variables.
\item
  Observational studies will always carry the possibility of confounding variables. Randomized experiments, which use random assignment, will have no confounding variables.

\texttt{R} is case sensitive, meaning it reads \texttt{data} differently from \texttt{Data}. If you get an error message, check that your capitalization is correct.

\texttt{R} does not like spaces or special characters This means the column and row headers in the data set should not have spaces, periods, commas, etc. Instead of titling the variable \texttt{column\ header}, use \texttt{column\_header} or \texttt{ColumnHeader}.

\textbf{Tidy data}: Data frames with

\rgi 1 row per \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_,

\rgi 1 column per \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

We highly recommend completing Tutorial 1 at the end of Chapter 1 (all four lessons) to give you practice with R/RStudio AND to help reflect on the content of Chapter 1: basics of data, sampling, study design, and scope of inference. These tutorials have some content questions and some places for you to practice using R online with some guidance.

\rgi \_\_ indicate spots you need to type in functions, data sets, or variable names.

\rgi There are Hint and Solution buttons on the R code box to help you.

We would not expect you to know the coding right now, especially for things like mutations or creating new variables in the data set. But seeing some initial coding for these more difficult functions will only make you more comfortable using the functions needed for this course!

Example: Gallatin Valley is the fastest growing county in Montana. You'll often hear Bozeman residents complaining about the `out-of-staters' moving in. A local real estate agent recorded data on a random sample of 100 home sales over the last year at her company and noted where the buyers were moving from as well as the age of the person or average age of a couple buying a home. The variable age was binned into two categories, ``Under30'' and ``Over30.'' Additionally, the variable, state the buyers were moving from, was created as a binary variable, ``Out'' for a location out of state and ``In'' for a location in state.

The following code reads in the data set, \texttt{moving\_to\_mt} and names the object moving.

For today's activity we will begin to use the statistical package R to analyze data through the IDE (integrated development environment) RStudio. For almost all activities and labs it will be necessary to upload the provided R script file from D2L for that day. Follow these steps to upload the necessary R script file for today's activity:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Download the Myopia Activity R script file from D2L.
\item
  Click ``Upload'' in the ``Files'' tab in the bottom right window of RStudio. In the pop-up window, click ``Choose File'', and navigate to the folder where the Myopia Activity R script file is saved (most likely in your downloads folder). Click ``Open''; then click ``Ok''.
\item
  You should see the uploaded file appear in the list of files in the bottom right window. Click on the file name to open the file in the Editor window (upper left window).
\end{itemize}

Notice that the first three lines of code contain a prompt called, \texttt{library}. Packages needed to run functions in R are stored in directories called libraries. When using the MSU RStudio server, all the packages needed for the class are already installed. We simply must tell R which packages we need for each R script file. We use the prompt \texttt{library} to load each \textbf{package} (or library) needed for each activity. Note, these \texttt{library} lines MUST be run each time you open a R script file in order for the functions in R to work. Before class today you should have worked through an R tutorial to prepare for class and to make sure you can login to the RStudio server. This tutorial will be a great resource as you begin to use R.

Highlight and run lines 1--3 to load the packages needed for today's activity. Notice the use of the \# symbol in the R script file. The \# sign is not part of the R code. It is used by these authors to add comments to the R code and explain what each call is telling the program to do.
R will ignore everything after a \# sign when executing the code. Refer to the instructions following the \# sign to understand what you need to enter in the code.

In a study reported in Nature (Quinn et al. 1999), a survey of 479 children found that those who had slept with a nightlight or in a fully lit room before the age of two had a higher incidence of nearsightedness (myopia) later in childhood.

In this study, there are two variables studied: \texttt{Light}: level of light in room at night (no light, nightlight, full light) and \texttt{Sight}: level of myopia developed later in childhood (high myopia, myopia, no myopia).

We could also choose to display the data as a proportion in a \textbf{relative frequency} bar plot. To find the relative frequency, divide the count in each level of myopia by the sample size. These are sample proportions. Notice that in this code we told R to create a bar plot with proportions.

In the following questions, use the table to calculate the described proportions. Notation is important for each calculation. Since this is sample data, it is appropriate to use statistic notation for the proportion, \(\hat{p}\). When calculating a proportion dependent on a single level of a variable, subscripts are needed when reporting the notation.

Two types of plots can be created to display two categorical variables. To examine the differences in level of myopia for the level of light, we will first create a segmented bar plot of \texttt{Light} segmented by \texttt{Sight}. To create the segmented bar plot enter the variable name, \texttt{Light} for \texttt{explanatory} and the variable name, \texttt{Sight} for \texttt{response} in the R script file in line 35.

  Bar charts can be used to graphically display a single categorical variable either as counts or proportions. Segmented bar charts and mosaic plots are used to display two categorical variables.
\item
  Segmented bar charts always have a scale from 0 - 100\%. The bars represent the outcomes of the explanatory variable. Each bar is segmented by the response variable. If the heights of each segment are the same for each bar there is no association between variables.
\item
  Mosaic plots are similar to segmented bar charts but the widths of the bars also show the number of observations within each outcome.

In Wednesday's activity, the code was provided to import the data set needed directly from the Stat 216 website. Follow these steps to upload and import the data set for today's lab.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Download the provided data set \texttt{IPED\_Data\_2018} from D2L
\item
  Upload the data set \texttt{IPEDS\_Data\_2018} to the RStudio server using the same steps to upload the R script file.
\item
  Click on ``Import Dataset'' in the Environment tab in the upper right hand corner.
\item
  Choose ``From Text(base)'' in the drop-down menu and select the correct csv file.
\item
  Be sure that ``Yes'' is selected next to ``Heading'' in the pop-up screen. Click ``Import''.
\item
  To view the data set, click on the data set name (\texttt{IPEDS\_Data\_2018}). Verify that that column names match the first column in the chart on the previous page. If the columns are named V1, V2, V3\ldots etc, you did not select ``Yes'' for ``Heading''.
\end{itemize}

Enter the name of the data set (see the environment tab) for \texttt{datasetname} in the R script file in line 6. We will look at the retention rates for the 4-year institutions only. Enter the variable name \texttt{Retention} for \texttt{variable} in line 12. Highlight and run lines 1 -- 12. \textbf{Note that the two lines of code (lines 8 and 10) are filtering to remove the 2-year institutions so we are only assessing Public 4-year and Private 4-year institutions.} The \texttt{favstats()} function from the \texttt{mosaic} package gives the summary statistics for a quantitative variable. The summary statistics give the two measures of center and two measures of spread for retention rate.

There are three type of plots used to plot a single quantitative variable: a dotplot, a histogram or a boxplot. A dotplot of retention rates would plot a dot for the retention rate for each 4-year institution.

We will create both a histogram and a boxplot of the variable \texttt{Retention}. Enter the name of the variable in both line 16 and line 23 for \texttt{variable} in the R script file. \textbf{Give each plot a descriptive title.} Highlight and run lines 15 -- 27 to give the histogram and boxplot. Notice that the \textbf{bin width} for the histogram is 10. For example, the first bin consists of the number of 4-year institutions in the data set with a retention rate of 0 to 10\%. It is important to note that a 4-year institution with a retention rate on the boundary of a bin will fall into the bin above it; for example, 10 would be counted in the bin 10--20.

\textbf{Export and upload both plots to Gradescope for your group.}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  To export the graphs: in the bottom right corner in the Plots tab, click on \texttt{Export}.
\item
  Then choose \texttt{Save\ as\ Image}. Save the image as a png. This will save your graph to the server.
\item
  In the Files tab, click on the box next to your saved image file, click \texttt{More} and choose \texttt{Export}. This will save your file to your downloads folder on your computer.

Values in the data set that are less than \(\text{Q}_1 - 1.5\text{xIQR}\) and greater than \(\text{Q}_3 + 1.5\text{xIQR}\) are considered outliers and are graphically represented by a dot outside of the whiskers on the box plot.
\item
  Data should be summarized numerically and displayed graphically to give us information about the study.
\item
  When comparing distributions of quantitative variables we look at the shape, center, spread, and for outliers. There are two measures of center: mean and the median and two measures of spread: standard deviation and the interquartile range, IQR = Q3 - Q1.
\item
  The median and the interquartile range are robust statistics, meaning that they are not affected by very large or very small values. When we have a skewed distribution the best measure of center is the median and the best measure of spread is the IQR.

Here you see a glimpse of the data. The 1236 rows correspond to the sample size. The case variable is labeling each pregnancy 1 through 1236. Then 7 variables are recorded. Birthweight (bwt), length of gestation in days, parity is called an indicator variable telling us if the pregnancy was a first pregnancy (labeled as 0) or not (labeled as 1) were recorded about the child and pregnancy. The age, height, and weight were recorded for the mother giving birth, as was smoke, another indicator variable where 0 means the mother did not smoke during pregnancy, and 1 indicates that she did smoke while pregnant.

The following shows a scatterplot of length of gestation as a predictor of birthweight.

Correlation measures the strength and the direction of the linear relationship between two quantitative variables. The closer the value of correlation to \(+1\) or \(-1\), the stronger the linear relationship. Values close to zero indicate a very weak linear relationship between the two variables. The following output shows a correlation matrix between several pairs of quantitative variables. Upload and open the Movie Profits Out of Class Activity F22 Code \texttt{R} script file.

\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Coefficient of determination (squared correlation)}

Another summary measure used to explain the linear relationship between two quantitative variables is the coefficient of determination (\(r^2\)). The coefficient of determination, \(r^2\), can also be used to describe the strength of the linear relationship between two quantitative variables. The value of \(r^2\) (a value between 0 and 1) represents the \textbf{proportion of variation in the response that is explained by the least squares line with the explanatory variable}. There are two ways to calculate the coefficient of determination:

~~~Square the correlation coefficient: \(R^2 = (R)^2\)

~~~Use the variances of the response and the residuals: \(R^2 = \dfrac{s_y^2 - s_{RES}^2}{s_y^2} = \dfrac{SST - SSE}{SST}\)

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{4}
\tightlist
\item
  Use the correlation, \(R\), found in question 2 of the activity, to calculate the coefficient of determination between budget and revenue, \(R^2\).
\end{enumerate}

\vspace{.4in}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{5}

\item
  The variance of the response variable, revenue in \$MM, is about \(s_{revenue}^2 = 8024.261\) \$MM\(^2\) and the variability in the residuals is about \(s_{RES}^2 = 4244.832\) \$MM\(^2\). Use these values to calculate the coefficient of determination. Verify that your answers to 6 and 7 are the same.
\end{enumerate}

\vspace{1in}

In the next part of the activity we will explore what the coefficient of determination measures.

In Figure \ref{fig:horizontal-line}, we see the data plotted with a horizontal line. Note that the line has a slope of zero, this shows no relationship between budget and revenue.

To look at the relationship between two quantitative variables we will create a scatterplot with the explanatory variable on the x-axis and the response variable on the y-axis. We can also find three summary measures for the linear relationship between the two variables: regression slope, correlation and the coefficient of determination.

We will look at the relationship between budget and revenue for movies released in 2016. Enter the explanatory variable name, \texttt{budget\_mil}, for \texttt{explanatory} and the response variable name, \texttt{revenue\_mil}, for \texttt{response} at line 7 in the \texttt{R} script file to create the scatterplot. (Note: both variables are measured in ``millions of dollars'' (\$MM).) Upload and open the Movie Profits Activity 4 F22 Code \texttt{R} script file. Highlight and run lines 1--12.

  \vspace{0.8in}
\end{enumerate}

You may remember from middle and high school that slope \(=\frac{\mbox{rise}}{\mbox{run}}\).

Using \(b_1\) to represent slope, we can write that as the fraction \(\frac{b_1}{1}\).

Therefore, the slope predicts how much the line will \emph{rise} for each \emph{run} of +1. In other words, as the \(x\) variable increases by 1 unit, the \(y\) variable is predicted to change (increase/decrease) by the value of slope.

\item
  Two quantitative variables are graphically displayed in a scatterplot. The explanatory variable is on the \(x\)-axis and the response variable is on the \(y\)-axis. When describing the relationship between two quantitative variables we look at the form (linear or non-linear), direction (positive or negative), strength, and for the presence of outliers.
\item
  There are three summary statistics used to summarize the relationship between two quantitative variables: correlation (\(R\)), slope of the regression line (\(b_1\)), and the coefficient of determination (\(R^2\)).
\item
  We can use the line of regression to predict values of the response variable for values of the explanatory variable. Do not use values of the explanatory variable that are outside of the range of values in the data set to predict values of the response variable (reflect on why this is true.). This is called \textbf{extrapolation}.

The Palmer Station Long Term Ecological Research Program sampled three penguin species on islands in the Palmer Archipelago in Antarctica. Researchers took various body measurements on the penguins, including bill depth and body mass. The researchers were interested in the relationship between bill depth and body mass and wondered if bill depth could be used to accurately predict the body mass of these three penguin species.

Upload and import the \texttt{Antarctica\_Penguins} csv file and the provided R script file for week 4 lab. Enter the name of the data set (see the environment tab) for \texttt{datasetname} in the R script file in line 5.

First we will create a scatterplot of the bill depth and body mass. Notice that we are using bill depth (mm) to predict body mass (g). This makes bill depth the explanatory variable. \textbf{Make sure to give your plot a descriptive title between the quotations in line 16.} Highlight and run lines 1--17 in the R script file. \textbf{Upload a copy of your scatterplot to Gradescope.}

Use the provided data set from the Islands (ExamReviewData.csv) and the appropriate Exam 1 Review R script file to answer the following questions. Each adult (\textgreater21) islander was selected at random from all adult islanders. Note that some islanders choose not to participate in the study. These islanders that did not consent to be in the study are removed from the dataset before analysis. Variables and their descriptions are listed below. Here is some more information about some of the variables collected. Music type (classical or heavy metal) was randomly assigned to the Islanders. Time to complete the puzzle cube was measured after listening to music for each Islander. Heart rate and blood glucose levels were both measured before and then after drinking a caffeinated beverage.

\(n\) = sample size

\(\hat{p}\) = sample proportion

\(\pi\) = population proportion

General steps of a hypothesis test:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Frame the research question in terms of hypotheses.
\item
  Collect and summarize data using a test statistic.
\item
  Assume the null hypothesis is true, and simulate or mathematically model a null distribution for the test statistic.
\item
  Compare the observed test statistic to the null distribution to calculate a p-value.
\item
  Make a conclusion based on the p-value and write the conclusion in context.
\end{enumerate}

Parameter: a value summarizing a variable(s) for a population.

Statistic: a value summarizing a variable(s) for a sample.

Sampling distribution: plot of statistics from 1000s of samples of the same size taken from the same population.

Standard deviation of a statistic: the variability of statistics from 1000s of samples; how far, on average, each statistic is from the true value of the parameter.

Standard error of a statistic: estimated standard deviation of a statistic.

Hypothesis test: a process to determine how strong the evidence of an effect is.

\rgi Also called a `significance test'.

Simulation-based method: Simulate lots of samples of size \(n\) under assumption of the null hypothesis, then find the proportion of the simulations that are at least as extreme as the observed sample statistic.

Null hypothesis (\(H_0\)): the skeptical perspective; no difference; no change; no effect; random chance; what the researcher hopes to prove is \textbf{wrong}.

Alternative hypothesis (\(H_A\)): the new perspective; a difference/increase/decrease; an effect; not random chance; what the researcher hopes to prove is \textbf{correct}.

P-value: probability of seeing the observed sample data, or something more extreme, assuming the null hypothesis is true.

\(\implies\) Lower the p-value the stronger the evidence AGAINST the null hypothesis and FOR the alternative hypothesis.

Decision: a determination of whether to `reject' or `fail to reject' a null hypothesis based on a p-value and a pre-set level of significance.

Significance level (\(\alpha\)): a threshold used to determine if a p-value provides enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis or not.

\rgi Common levels of \(\alpha\) include 0.01, 0.05, and 0.10.

Statistically significant: results are considered statistically significant if the p-value is below the significance level.

Confidence interval: a process to determine how large an effect is; a range of plausible values for the parameter; also called `estimation'.

Margin of error: the value that is added to and subtracted from the sample statistic to create a confidence interval; half the width of a confidence interval.

A study by Hamblin, Wynn, and Bloom reported in Nature (Hamblin, Wynn, and Bloom 2007) was intended to check young kids' feelings about helpful and non-helpful behavior. Non-verbal infants ages 6 to 10 months were shown short videos with different shapes either helping or hindering the climber. As a class we will watch this short video to see how the experiment was run: \url{https://youtu.be/anCaGBsBOxM}. Researchers were hoping to assess: Are infants more likely to preferentially choose the helper toy over the hinderer toy? In the study, of the 16 infants age 6 to 10 months, 14 chose the \emph{helper} toy and 2 chose the \emph{hinderer} toy.

In this study, the \textbf{observational units are the infants ages 6 to 10 months}. The \textbf{variable measured on each observational unit (infant) is whether they chose the helper or the hinderer toy}. This is a categorical variable so we will be assessing the proportion of infants ages 6 to 10 months that choose the helper toy. Choosing the helper toy in this study will be considered a success.

We cannot assess whether infants are more likely to choose the helper toy based on the statistic and plot alone. The next step is to analyze the data by using a hypothesis test to discover if there is evidence against the null hypothesis.

When performing a hypothesis test, we must first identify the null hypothesis. The null hypothesis is written about the parameter of interest, or the value that summarizes the variable in the population.

For this study, the parameter of interest is the \textbf{true or population proportion of infants ages 6--10 months who will choose the helper toy}.

If the children are just randomly choosing the toy, we would expect half (0.5) of the infants to choose the helper toy. This is the null value for our study.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{4}
\tightlist
\item
  Using the parameter of interest given above, write out the null hypothesis in words. That is, what do we assume to be true about the parameter of interest when we perform our simulation?
  \vspace{0.8in}
\end{enumerate}

The notation used for a population proportion (or probability, or true proportion) is \(\pi\). Since this summarizes a population, it is a parameter. When writing the \textbf{null hypothesis} in notation, we set the parameter equal to the null value, \(H_0: \pi = \pi_0\).

\newpage

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{5}
\tightlist
\item
  Write the null hypothesis in notation using the null value of 0.5 in place of \(\pi_0\) in the equation given on the previous page.
\end{enumerate}

\vspace{0.5in}

The \textbf{alternative hypothesis} is the claim to be tested and the direction of the claim (less than, greater than, or not equal to) is based on the research question.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{6}
\tightlist
\item
  Based on the research question from question 1, are we testing that the parameter is greater than 0.5, less than 0.5 or different than 0.5?

\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{7}
\tightlist
\item
  Write out the alternative hypothesis in notation.
\end{enumerate}

\vspace{0.5in}

Remember that when utilizing a hypothesis test, we are evaluating two competing possibilities. For this study the \textbf{two possibilities} are either\ldots{}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The true proportion of infants who choose the helper is 0.5 and our results just occurred by random chance; or,
\item
  The true proportion of infants who choose the helper is greater than 0.5 and our results reflect this.
\end{itemize}

Notice that these two competing possibilities represent the null and alternative hypotheses.

We will now simulate a one sample of a \textbf{null distribution} of sample proportions. The null distribution is created under the assumption the null hypothesis is true. In this case, we assume the true proportion of infants who choose the helper is 0.5, so we will create 1000 (or more) different simulations of 16 infants under this assumption.

Let's think about how to use a coin to create one simulation of 16 infants under the assumption the null hypothesis is true. Let heads equal infant chose the helper toy and tails equal infant chose the hinderer toy.

\item
  In a hypothesis test we have two competing hypotheses, the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis. The null hypothesis represents either a skeptical perspective or a perspective of no difference or no effect. The alternative hypothesis represents a new perspective such as the possibility that there has been a change or that there is a treatment effect in an experiment.
\item
  In a simulation-based test, we create a distribution of possible simulated statistics for our sample if the null hypothesis is true. Then we see if the calculated observed statistic from the data is likely or unlikely to occur when compared to the null distribution.
\item
  To create one simulated sample on the null distribution for a sample proportion, spin a spinner with probability equal to \(\pi_0\) (the null value), \(n\) times or draw with replacement \(n\) times from a deck of cards created to reflect \(\pi_0\) as the probability of success. Calculate and plot the proportion of successes from the simulated sample.

In the last class, we found very strong evidence that the true proportion of infants who will choose the helper character is greater than 0.5. But what \emph{is} the true proportion of infants who will choose the helper character? We will use this same study to estimate this parameter of interest by creating a confidence interval.

As a reminder: Do young children know the difference between helpful and unhelpful behavior? A study by Hamblin, Wynn, and Bloom reported in Nature (Hamblin, Wynn, and Bloom 2007) was intended to check young kids' feelings about helpful and non-helpful behavior. Non-verbal infants ages 6 to 10 months were shown short videos with different shapes either helping or hindering the climber. Researchers were hoping to assess: Are infants more likely to preferentially choose the helper toy over the hinderer toy? In the study, of the 16 infants age 6 to 10 months, 14 chose the \emph{helper} toy and 2 chose the \emph{hinderer} toy.

A \textbf{point estimate} (our observed statistic) provides a single plausible value for a parameter. However, a point estimate is rarely perfect; usually there is some error in the estimate. In addition to supplying a point estimate of a parameter, a next logical step would be to provide a plausible \emph{range} of values for the parameter. This plausible range of values for the population parameter is called an \textbf{interval estimate} or \textbf{confidence interval}.

  Researchers were interested if infants observe social cues and would be more likely to choose the helper toy over the hinderer toy. In a sample of (sample size) \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_infants, (number of successes) \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_chose the helper toy. A simulation null distribution with 1000 simulations was created in RStudio. The p-value was found by calculating the proportion of simulations in the null distribution at the sample statistic of 0.875 and greater. This resulted in a p-value of (value of p-value)\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. We would observe a sample proportion of (value of the sample proportion) \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ or (greater, less, more extreme) \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ with a probability of (value of p-value)\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\\
  IF we assume (\(H_0\) in context) \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.
  Based on this p-value, there is (very strong/little to no) \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ evidence that the (sample/true)\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ proportion of infants age 6 to 10 months who will choose the helper toy is (greater than, less than, not equal to) \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 0.5. In addition, a 95\% confidence interval was found for the parameter of interest. We are 95\% confident that the (true/sample)\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ proportion of infants age 6 to 10 months who will choose the helper toy is between (lower value)\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ and (upper value)\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. The results of this study can be generalized to (all infants age 6 to 10 months/infants similar to those in this study)\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ as the researchers (did/did not)\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ select a random sample.

  The goal in a hypothesis test is to assess the strength of evidence for an effect, while the goal in creating a confidence interval is to determine how large the effect is. A \textbf{confidence interval} is a range of \emph{plausible} values for the parameter of interest.
\item
  A confidence interval is built around the point estimate or observed calculated statistic from the sample. This means that the sample statistic is always the center of the confidence interval. A confidence interval includes a measure of sample to sample variability represented by the \textbf{margin of error}.
\item
  In simulation-based methods (bootstrapping), a simulated distribution of possible sample statistics is created showing the possible sample-to-sample variability. Then we find the middle \(X\) percent of the distribution around the sample statistic using the percentile method to give the range of values for the confidence interval. This shows us that we are \(X\)\% confident that the parameter is within this range, where \(X\) represents the level of confidence.
\item
  When the null value is within the confidence interval, it is a plausible value for the parameter of interest; thus, we would find a larger p-value for a hypothesis test of that null value. Conversely, if the null value is NOT within the confidence interval, we would find a small p-value for the hypothesis test and strong evidence against this null hypothesis.
\item
  To create one simulated sample on the bootstrap distribution for a sample proportion, label \(n\) cards with the original responses. Draw with replacement \(n\) times. Calculate and plot the resampled proportion of successes.

Left-handedness is a trait that is found in about 10\% of the general population. Past studies have shown that left-handed men are over-represented among professional boxers (Richardson and Gilman 2019). The fighting claim states that left-handed men have an advantage in competition. In this random sample of 500 male professional boxers, we want to see if there is an over-prevalence of left-handed fighters. In the sample of 500 male boxers, 81 were left-handed.

The sampling distribution of a single proportion --- how that proportion varies from sample to sample --- can be mathematically modeled using the normal distribution if certain conditions are met.

Conditions for the sampling distribution of \(\hat{p}\) to follow an approximate normal distribution:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Independence}: The sample's observations are independent, e.g., are from a simple random sample. (\emph{Remember}: This also must be true to use simulation methods!)
\item
  \textbf{Success-failure condition}: We \emph{expect} to see at least 10 successes and 10 failures in the sample, \(n\hat{p}≥10\) and \(n(1-\hat{p})≥10\).

\newpage

To calculate the standardized statistic we use the general formula

\[
Z = \frac{\text{point estimate} - \text{null value}}{SE_0(\text{point estimate})}.
\]
For a single categorical variable the standardized sample proportion is calculated using

\[
Z = \frac{\hat{p} - \pi_0}{SE_0(\hat{p})},
\]
where the standard error is calculated using the null value:

\[SE_0(\hat{p})=\sqrt{\frac{\pi_0(1-\pi_0)}{n}}\].

The standard error of the sample proportion measures the variability of possible sample proportions from the actual proportion. In other words, how far each possible sample proportion is from the actual proportion on average. For this study, the null standard error of the sample proportion is calculated using the null value, 0.1.

\[SE_0(\hat{p})=\sqrt{\frac{0.1(1-0.1)}{500}} = 0.013\].

Each sample proportion of male boxers that are left-handed is 0.013 from the true proportion of male boxers that are left-handed, on average.

In the out of class activity we found very strong evidence that the true proportion of male boxers that are left-handed is greater than 0.1. In this activity we will use the same data set to find the theory-based 95\% confidence interval.

Remember from the last activity: Left-handedness is a trait that is found in about 10\% of the general population. Past studies have shown that left-handed men are over-represented among professional boxers. The fighting claim states that left-handed men have an advantage in competition. In this random sample of 500 male professional boxers, we want to see if there is an over-prevalence of left-handed fighters. In the sample of 500 male boxers, 81 were left-handed.

Recall that to use theory-based methods we must check the conditions to approximate the sampling distribution with the normal distribution. From the previous activity, we saw that independence was satisfied as the researchers took a random sample and that the sample had more than 10 successes and 10 failures.

To calculate a theory-based 95\% confidence interval for \(\pi\), we will first find the \textbf{standard error} of \(\hat{p}\) by plugging in the value of \(\hat{p}\) for \(\pi\) in \(SD(\hat{p})\):

\[SE(\hat{p}) = \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{n}}.\]
Note that we do not include a ``0'' subscript, since we are not assuming a null hypothesis.

  Calculate the standard error of the sample proportion to find a 95\% confidence interval.
\end{enumerate}

\vspace{0.5in}

To find the confidence interval, we will add and subtract the \textbf{margin of error} to the point estimate:

\[\text{point estimate}\pm\text{margin of error}\]
\[\hat{p}\pm z^* \times SE(\hat{p})\]
\[ME = z^* \times SE(\hat{p})\]

The \(z^*\) multiplier is the percentile of a standard normal distribution that corresponds to our confidence level. If our confidence level is 95\%, we find the Z values that encompass the middle 95\% of the standard normal distribution. If 95\% of the standard normal distribution should be in the middle, that leaves 5\% in the tails, or 2.5\% in each tail.

It is widely reported that the median recovery time for athletes who undergo surgery to repair a torn anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is 8 months, indicating that 50\% of athletes return to their sport within 8 months after an ACL surgery. Suppose a local physical therapy company hopes to advertise that their rehabilitation program can increase this percentage.

  \textbf{Use proper notation to write the null and alternative hypothesis the company would need to test in order to check their advertisement claim.}
  \vspace{0.5in}
\end{enumerate}

After determining hypotheses and prior to collecting data, researchers should set a \textbf{significance level} for a hypothesis test. The significance level, represented by \(\alpha\) and most commonly 0.01, 0.05, or 0.10, is a cut-off for determining whether a p-value is small or not. The \emph{smaller} the p-value, the \emph{stronger} the evidence against the null hypothesis, so a p-value that is smaller than or equal to the significance level is strong enough evidence to \emph{reject the null hypothesis}. Similarly, the \emph{larger} the p-value, the \emph{weaker} the evidence against the null hypothesis, so a p-value that is larger than the significance level does not provide enough evidence against the null hypothesis and the researcher would \emph{fail to reject the null hypothesis}. Rejecting the null hypothesis or failing to reject the null hypothesis are the two \textbf{decisions} that can be made based on the data collected.

As you have already learned in this course, sample size of a study is extremely important. Often times, researchers will conduct what is called a power analysis to determine the appropriate sample size based on the goals of their research, including a desired \textbf{power} of their test. Power is the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis, or the probability of the data providing strong evidence against the null hypothesis \emph{when the null hypothesis is false}.

The remainder of this lab will be spent investigating how different factors influence the power of a test, after which you will complete a power analysis for this physical therapy company.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Navigate to \url{https://istats.shinyapps.io/power/}. \emph{Please note that this applet uses \(p_0\) to represent the null value rather than \(\pi_0\).}
\item
  Use the scale under ``Null Hypothesis value \(p_0\)'' to change the value to your null value from question 2.
\item
  Change the ``Alternative Hypothesis'' to the direction you wrote in question 2.
\item
  Leave all boxes un-checked. Do not change the scales under ``True value of \(p_0\)'', ``Sample size n'', or ``Type I Error \(\alpha\)''
\end{itemize}

The red distribution you see is the scaled-Normal distribution representing the null distribution for this hypothesis test, if the sample size was 50 and the significance level was 0.05. This means the red distribution is showing the probability of each possible sample proportion of athletes who returned to their sport within 8 months (\(\hat{p}\)) if we assume the null hypothesis is true.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}

  Notice that there are some sample proportions under the red line (when the null hypothesis is true) which would lead us to reject the null hypothesis.

  \vspace{0.4in}
\end{enumerate}

Check the ``Type I Error'' box under \textbf{Display}. This should verify (or correct) your answer to question 5! The area shaded in red represents the probability of making a \textbf{type 1 error} in our hypothesis test. Recall that a type 1 error is when we reject the null hypothesis even though the null hypothesis is true. To reject the null hypothesis, the p-value, which was found assuming the null hypothesis is true, must be less than or equal to the significance level. Therefore the significance level is the maximum probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when the null hypothesis is true, so the significance level IS the probability of making a type 1 error in a hypothesis test!

\(n\) = sample size

\(\hat{p}\) = sample proportion

\(\pi\) = population proportion

General steps of a hypothesis test:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Frame the research question in terms of hypotheses.
\item
  Collect and summarize data using a test statistic.
\item
  Assume the null hypothesis is true, and simulate or mathematically model a null distribution for the test statistic.
\item
  Compare the observed test (standardized) statistic to the null distribution to calculate a p-value.
\item
  Make a conclusion based on the p-value and write the conclusion in context.
\end{enumerate}

Parameter: a value summarizing a variable(s) for a population.

Statistic: a value summarizing a variable(s) for a sample.

Sampling distribution: plot of statistics from 1000s of samples of the same size taken from the same population.

Standard deviation of a statistic: the variability of statistics from 1000s of samples; how far, on average, each statistic is from the true value of the parameter.

Standard error of a statistic: estimated standard deviation of a statistic.

Hypothesis test: a process to determine how strong the evidence of an effect is.

\rgi Also called a `significance test'.

Simulation-based method: Simulate lots of samples of size \(n\) under assumption of the null hypothesis, then find the proportion of the simulations that are at least as extreme as the observed sample statistic.

Null hypothesis (\(H_0\)): the skeptical perspective; no difference; no change; no effect; random chance; what the researcher hopes to prove is \textbf{wrong}.

Alternative hypothesis (\(H_A\)): the new perspective; a difference/increase/decrease; an effect; not random chance; what the researcher hopes to prove is \textbf{correct}.

Null value: the value of the parameter when we assume the null hypothesis is true (labeled as \(parameter_0\)).

Null distribution: the simulated or modeled distribution of statistics (sampling distribution) we would expect to occur if the null hypothesis is true.

P-value: probability of seeing the observed sample data, or something more extreme, assuming the null hypothesis is true.

\(\implies\) Lower the p-value the stronger the evidence AGAINST the null hypothesis and FOR the alternative hypothesis.

Decision: a determination of whether to `reject' or `fail to reject' a null hypothesis based on a p-value and a pre-set level of significance.

Significance level (\(\alpha\)): a threshold used to determine if a p-value provides enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis or not.

\rgi Common levels of \(\alpha\) include 0.01, 0.05, and 0.10.

Statistically significant: results are considered statistically significant if the p-value is below the significance level.

Confidence interval: a process to determine how large an effect is; a range of plausible values for the parameter. Also called `estimation'.

Margin of error: the value that is added to and subtracted from the sample statistic to create a confidence interval; half the width of a confidence interval.

Bootstrapping: the process of drawing with replacement \(n\) times from the original sample.

Bootstrapped resample: a random sample of size \(n\) from the original sample, selected with replacement.

Bootstrapped statistic: the statistic recorded from the bootstrapped resample.

Confidence level: how confident we are that the confidence interval will capture the parameter.

Researchers at the Princeton University wanted to investigate influences on behavior (Darley and Batson 1973). The researchers randomly selected 67 students from the Princeton Theological Seminary to participate in a study. Only 47 students chose to participate in the study, and the data below includes 40 of those students (7 students were removed from the study for various reasons). As all participants were theology majors planning a career as a preacher, the expectation was that all would have a similar disposition when it comes to helping behavior. Each student was then shown a 5-minute presentation on the Good Samaritan, a parable in the Bible which emphasizes the importance of helping others. After the presentation, the students were told they needed to give a talk on the Good Samaritan parable at a building across campus. Half the students were told they were late for the presentation; the other half told they could take their time getting across campus (the condition was randomly assigned). On the way between buildings, an actor pretending to be a homeless person in distress asked the student for help. The researchers recorded whether the student helped the actor or not. The results of the study are shown in the table below. Do these data provide evidence that those in a hurry will be less likely to help people in need in this situation? Use the order of subtraction hurry -- no hurry.

In the out of class activity, we began a test of significance to see if people in a hurry are less likely to help those in need. Today we will use RStudio to continue to assess this research question.

Researchers at the Princeton University wanted to investigate influences on behavior (Darley and Batson 1973). The researchers randomly selected 67 students from the Princeton Theological Seminary to participate in a study. Only 47 students chose to participate in the study, and the data below includes 40 of those students (7 students were removed from the study for various reasons). As all participants were theology majors planning a career as a preacher, the expectation was that all would have a similar disposition when it comes to helping behavior. Each student was then shown a 5-minute presentation on the Good Samaritan, a parable in the Bible which emphasizes the importance of helping others. After the presentation, the students were told they needed to give a talk on the Good Samaritan parable at a building across campus. Half the students were told they were late for the presentation; the other half told they could take their time getting across campus (the condition was randomly assigned). On the way between buildings, an actor pretending to be a homeless person in distress asked the student for help. The researchers recorded whether the student helped the actor or not. The results of the study are shown in the table below. Do these data provide evidence that those in a hurry will be less likely to help people in need in this situation?

\subsection{Poisonous Mushrooms}\label{poisonous-mushrooms}}

Wild mushrooms, such as chanterelles or morels, are delicious, but eating wild mushrooms carries the risk of accidental poisoning. Even a single bite of the wrong mushroom can be enough to cause fatal poisoning. An amateur mushroom hunter is interested in finding an easy rule to differentiate poisonous and edible mushrooms. They think that the mushroom's gills (the part which holds and releases spores) might be related to a mushroom's edibility. They used a data set of 8124 mushrooms and their descriptions. For each mushroom, the data set includes whether it is edible (e) or poisonous (p) and the spacing of the gills (Broad (b) or Narrow (n)). Is there evidence gill size is associated with whether a mushroom is poisonous? PLEASE NOTE: According to The Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Mushrooms, there is no simple rule for determining the edibility of a mushroom; no rule like ``leaflets three, let it be'\,' for Poisonous Oak and Ivy.

Upload and open the R script file for Week 8 lab. Upload and import the csv file, \texttt{mushrooms}. Enter the name of the data set (see the environment tab) for datasetname in the R script file in line 6. Highlight and run lines 1--7 to get the counts for each combination of categories.

General steps of a hypothesis test:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Frame the research question in terms of hypotheses.
\item
  Collect and summarize data using a test statistic.
\item
  Assume the null hypothesis is true, and simulate or mathematically model a null distribution for the test statistic.
\item
  Compare the observed test (standardized) statistic to the null distribution to calculate a p-value.
\item
  Make a conclusion based on the p-value and write the conclusion in context.
\end{enumerate}

Parameter: a value summarizing a variable(s) for a population.

Statistic: a value summarizing a variable(s) for a sample.

Sampling distribution: plot of statistics from 1000s of samples of the same size taken from the same population.

Standard deviation of a statistic: the variability of statistics from 1000s of samples; how far, on average, each statistic is from the true value of the parameter.

Standard error of a statistic: estimated standard deviation of a statistic.

Hypothesis test: a process to determine how strong the evidence of an effect is.

\rgi Also called a `significance test'.

Theory-based method: Develop a mathematical model for the sampling distribution of the statistic under the null hypothesis and use the model to calculate the probability of the observed sample statistic (or one more extreme) occurring.

Null hypothesis (\(H_0\)): the skeptical perspective; no difference; no change; no effect; random chance; what the researcher hopes to prove is \textbf{wrong}.

Alternative hypothesis (\(H_A\)): the new perspective; a difference/increase/decrease; an effect; not random chance; what the researcher hopes to prove is \textbf{correct}.

Null value: the value of the parameter when we assume the null hypothesis is true (labeled as \(parameter_0\)).

Null distribution: the simulated or modeled distribution of statistics (sampling distribution) we would expect to occur if the null hypothesis is true.

P-value: probability of seeing the observed sample data, or something more extreme, assuming the null hypothesis is true.

\(\implies\) Lower the p-value the stronger the evidence AGAINST the null hypothesis and FOR the alternative hypothesis.

Decision: a determination of whether to `reject' or `fail to reject' a null hypothesis based on a p-value and a pre-set level of significance.

Significance level (\(\alpha\)): a threshold used to determine if a p-value provides enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis or not.

\rgi Common levels of \(\alpha\) include 0.01, 0.05, and 0.10.

Statistically significant: results are considered statistically significant if the p-value is below the significance level.

Confidence interval: a process to determine how large an effect is; a range of plausible values for the parameter. Also called `estimation'.

Margin of error: the value that is added to and subtracted from the sample statistic to create a confidence interval; half the width of a confidence interval.

Confidence level: how confident we are that the confidence interval will capture the parameter.

Two variables measured on this data set is whether the institution is a land grant university and whether the institution offers tenure.

In this activity we will focus on theory-based methods to calculate a confidence interval. Recall from Activity 9A, the sampling distribution of a difference in proportions can be mathematically modeled using the normal distribution if certain conditions are met.

Conditions for the sampling distribution of \(\hat{p}_1-\hat{p}_2\) to follow an approximate normal distribution:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Independence}: The data are independent within and between the two groups. (\emph{Remember}: This also must be true to use simulation methods!)
\item
  \textbf{Success-failure condition}: This condition is met if we have at least 10 successes and 10 failures in each sample. Equivalently, we check that all cells in the table have at least 10 observations.
\end{itemize}

  Explain why a theory-based confidence interval for the Good Samaritan study from last week would NOT be similar to the bootstrap interval created.

\vspace{1in}

For this activity we will again use the Helmet Use and Head Injury data set. In Activity 9A we saw that there was evidence that helmet use is associated with a reduced risk of head injury. Today we will estimate the difference in proportion of head injuries for those who wore helmets and those who did not.

In ``Helmet Use and Risk of Head Injuries in Alpine Skiers and Snowboarders'' by Sullheim et. al., (Sulheim et al. 2017), we can see the summary results from a random sample of 3562 skiers and snowboarders involved in accidents in the two-way table below.

  Write the parameter of interest for this study in context of the problem.
\end{enumerate}

\vspace{0.8in}

To find a confidence interval for the difference in proportions we will add and subtract the margin of error from the point estimate to find the two endpoints.

\[\hat{p}_1-\hat{p}_2\pm z^*\times SE(\hat{p}_1-\hat{p}_2), \hspace{.2cm} \text{where}\]
\[SE(\hat{p}_1-\hat{p}_2) = \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}_1 \times  (1-\hat{p}_1)}{n_1}+\frac{\hat{p}_2 \times  (1-\hat{p}_2)}{n_2}}\]

Note that the formula changes when calculating the variability around the statistic in order to calculate a confidence interval from the formula used in Activity 9A! Here, we use the sample proportions for each group to calculate the standard error for the difference in proportions since we are not assuming that the true difference is zero.

To calculate the standard error for a difference in proportions to create a 90\% confidence interval we substitute in the two sample proportions and the sample size for each group into the equation above.

\[n_1 = 752, n_2 = 2810, \hat{p}_h = \frac{96}{752} = 0.128, \hat{p}_n = \frac{480}{2810} = 0.171\]

\[SE(\hat{p}_1-\hat{p}_2) = \sqrt{\frac{0.128\times (1-0.128)}{752}+\frac{0.171\times (1-0.171)}{2810}} = 0.014\]

Recall that the \(z^*\) multiplier is the percentile of a standard normal distribution that corresponds to our confidence level. If our confidence level is 90\%, we find the Z values that encompass the middle 90\% of the standard normal distribution. If 90\% of the standard normal distribution should be in the middle, that leaves 10\% in the tails, or 5\% in each tail. The \texttt{qnorm()} function in R will tell us the \(z^*\) value for the desired percentile (in this case, 90\% + 5\% = 95\% percentile).

In ``Helmet Use and Risk of Head Injuries in Alpine Skiers and Snowboarders'' by Sullheim et. al., (Sulheim et al. 2017), we can see the summary results from a random sample of 3562 skiers and snowboarders involved in accidents in the two-way table below. Is there evidence that safety helmet use is associated with a reduced risk of head injury for skiers and snowboarders?

For this study the observational units are skiers and snowboarders involved in accidents. A success will be considered a head injury in this context and we are comparing the groups helmet use (group 1) and no helmet use (group 2). Use helmet use - no helmet use as the order of subtraction. Highlight and runs lines 1--6 in the provided Rscript file to create the summary data table.

To test the null hypothesis, we could use simulation-based methods as we did in Activity 8A. In this activity, we will focus on theory-based methods. Like with a single proportion, the sampling distribution of a difference in sample proportions can be mathematically modeled using the normal distribution if certain conditions are met.

Conditions for the sampling distribution of \(\hat{p}_1-\hat{p}_2\) to follow an approximate normal distribution:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Independence}: The data are independent within and between the two groups. (\emph{Remember}: This also must be true to use simulation methods!)
\item
  \textbf{Success-failure condition}: This condition is met if we have at least 10 successes and 10 failures in each sample. Equivalently, we check that all cells in the table have at least 10 observations.

To calculate the standardized statistic we use:

\[
Z = \frac{(\hat{p_1} - \hat{p_2}) - \text{null value}}{SE_0(\hat{p_1}-\hat{p}_2)},
\]

where the null standard error is calculated using the pooled proportion of successes:

\[
SE_0(\hat{p}_1-\hat{p}_2)=\sqrt{\hat{p}_{pool}\times (1-\hat{p}_{pool})\times \left(\frac{1}{n_1}+\frac{1}{n_2}\right)}.
\]

For this study we would first calculate the pooled proportion of successes.

\[\hat{p}_{pool} = \frac{\text{number of "successes"}}{\text{number of cases}} = \frac{576}{3562} = 0.162\]
We use the value for the pooled proportion of successes to calculate the \(SE_0(\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2)\).

\[
SE_0(\hat{p}_1-\hat{p}_2)=\sqrt{0.162 \times (1-0.162)\times \left(\frac{1}{752}+\frac{1}{2810}\right)} = 0.015

Researchers compared the efficacy of two treatment regimens to achieve durable glycemic control in children and adolescents with recent-onset type 2 diabetes (Group 2012). A convenience sample of patients 10 to 17 years of age with recent-onset type 2 diabetes were randomly assigned to either a medication (rosiglitazone) or a lifestyle-intervention program focusing on weight loss through eating and activity. Researchers measured whether the patient still needs insulin (failure) or had glycemic control (success). Of the 233 children who received the Rosiglitazone treatment, 143 had glycemic control, while of the 234 who went through the lifestyle-intervention program, 125 had glycemic control. Is there evidence that there is difference in proportion of patients that achieve durable glycemic control between the two treatments? Use Rosiglitazone -- Lifestyle as the order of subtraction.

\(n\) = sample size

\(s\) = sample standard deviation

\(\mu\) = population mean

\(\sigma\) = population standard deviation

General steps of a hypothesis test:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Frame the research question in terms of hypotheses.
\item
  Collect and summarize data using a test statistic.
\item
  Assume the null hypothesis is true, and simulate or mathematically model a null distribution for the test statistic.
\item
  Compare the observed test statistic to the null distribution to calculate a p-value.
\item
  Make a conclusion based on the p-value and write the conclusion in context.
\end{enumerate}

Parameter: a value summarizing a variable(s) for a population.

Statistic: a value summarizing a variable(s) for a sample.

Sampling distribution: plot of statistics from 1000s of samples of the same size taken from the same population.

Standard deviation of a statistic: the variability of statistics from 1000s of samples; how far, on average, each statistic is from the true value of the parameter.

Standard error of a statistic: estimated standard deviation of a statistic.

Hypothesis test: a process to determine how strong the evidence of an effect is. Also called a `significance test'.

Simulation-based method: Simulate lots of samples of size \(n\) under assumption of the null hypothesis, then find the proportion of the simulations that are at least as extreme as the observed sample statistic.

Theory-based method: Develop a mathematical model for the sampling distribution of the statistic under the null hypothesis and use the model to calculate the probability of the observed sample statistic (or one more extreme) occurring.

Null hypothesis (\(H_0\)): the skeptical perspective; no difference; no change; no effect; random chance; what the researcher hopes to prove is \textbf{wrong}.

Alternative hypothesis (\(H_A\)): the new perspective; a difference/increase/decrease; an effect; not random chance; what the researcher hopes to prove is \textbf{correct}.

Null value: the value of the parameter when we assume the null hypothesis is true (labeled as \(parameter_0\)).

Null distribution: the simulated or modeled distribution of statistics (sampling distribution) we would expect to occur if the null hypothesis is true.

P-value: probability of seeing the observed sample data, or something more extreme, assuming the null hypothesis is true.

\(\implies\) Lower the p-value the stronger the evidence AGAINST the null hypothesis and FOR the alternative hypothesis.

Decision: a determination of whether to reject or fail to reject a null hypothesis based on a p-value and a pre-set level of significance.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  If p-value \(\leq \alpha\), then reject \(H_0\).
\item
  If p-value \(> \alpha\), then fail to reject \(H_0\).
\end{itemize}

Significance level (\(\alpha\)): a threshold used to determine if a p-value provides enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis or not.

\rgi Common levels of \(\alpha\) include 0.01, 0.05, and 0.10.

Statistically significant: results are considered statistically significant if the p-value is below the significance level.

Confidence interval: a process to determine how large an effect is; a range of plausible values for the parameter. Also called `estimation'.

Margin of error: the value that is added to and subtracted from the sample statistic to create a confidence interval; half the width of a confidence interval.

Bootstrapping: the process of drawing with replacement \(n\) times from the original sample.

Bootstrapped resample: a random sample of size \(n\) from the original sample, selected with replacement.

Bootstrapped statistic: the statistic recorded from the bootstrapped resample.

Confidence level: how confident we are that the confidence interval will capture the parameter.

Bootstrap \(X\)\% confidence interval: (\((\frac{(1-X)}{2})^{th}\) percentile, \((X+(\frac{(1-X)}{2})^{th}\) percentile) of a bootstrap distribution.

Central Limit Theorem: For large sample sizes, the sampling distribution of a sample mean (or proportion) will be approximately normal (bell-shaped and symmetric).

Example: Three hundred registered voters were selected at random to participate in a study on attitudes about how well the president is performing. They were each asked to answer a short multiple-choice questionnaire and then they watched a 20-minute video that presented information about the job description of the president. After watching the video, the same 300 selected voters were asked to answer a follow-up multiple-choice questionnaire.

Fifty skiers volunteered to study how different waxes impacted their downhill race times. The participants were split into groups of two based on similar race times from the previous race. One of the two then had their skis treated with Wax A while the other was treated with Wax B. The downhill ski race times were then measured for each of the 25 volunteers who used Wax A as well as for each of the 25 volunteers who used Wax B.

The abstract of the article ``Studies of interference in serial verbal reactions'' in the \emph{Journal of Experimental Psychology} (Stroop 1935) reads:

\begin{quote}
In this study pairs of conflicting stimuli, both being inherent aspects of the same symbols, were presented simultaneously (a name of one color printed in the ink of another color---a word stimulus and a color stimulus).
The difference in time for reading the words printed in colors and the same words printed in black is the measure of interference of color stimuli upon reading words. \ldots{}
The interference of conflicting color stimuli upon the time for reading 100 words (each word naming a color unlike the ink-color of its print) caused an increase of 2.3 seconds or 5.6\% over the normal time for reading the same words printed in black.
\end{quote}

The article reports on the results of a study in which seventy college undergraduates were given forms with 100 names of colors written in black ink, and the same 100 names of colors written in another color (i.e., the word purple written in green ink). The total time (in seconds) for reading the 100 words printed in black, and the total time (in seconds) for reading the 100 words printed in different colors were recorded for each subject. The order in which the forms (black or color) were given was randomized to the subjects. Does printing the name of colors in a different color increase the time it takes to read the words? Use color - black as the order of subtraction.

In general, the sampling distribution for a sample mean, \(\bar{x}\), based on a sample of size \(n\) from a population with a true mean \(\mu\) and true standard deviation \(\sigma\) can be modeled using a Normal distribution when certain conditions are met.

Conditions for the sampling distribution of \(\bar{x}\) to follow an approximate Normal distribution:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Independence}: The sample's observations are independent. For paired data, that means each pairwise difference should be independent.
\item
  \textbf{Normality}: The data should be approximately normal or the sample size should be large.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    \(n < 30\): If the sample size \(n\) is less than 30 and the distribution of the data is approximately normal with no clear outliers in the data, then we typically assume the data come from a nearly normal distribution to satisfy the condition.
  \item
    \(n \geq 30\): If the sample size \(n\) is at least 30 and there are no particularly extreme outliers in the data, then we typically assume the sampling distribution of \(\bar{x}\) is nearly normal, even if the underlying distribution of individual observations is not.
  \item
    \(n \geq 100\): If the sample size \(n\) is at least 100 (regardless of the presence of skew or outliers), we typically assume the sampling distribution of \(\bar{x}\) is nearly normal, even if the underlying distribution of individual observations is not.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}

}

\caption{Comparison of the standard Normal vs t-distribution with various degrees of freedom}\label{fig:tdist}
\end{figure}

Like we saw in Chapter \textbf{5}, we will not know the values of the parameters and must use the sample data to estimate them. Unlike with proportions, in which we only needed to estimate the population proportion, \(\pi\), quantitative sample data must be used to estimate both a population mean \(\mu\) and a population standard deviation \(\sigma\). This additional uncertainty will require us to use a theoretical distribution that is just a bit wider than the Normal distribution. Enter the \textbf{\(t\)-distribution}!

As you can seen from Figure \ref{fig:tdist}, the \(t\)-distributions (dashed and dotted lines) are centered at 0 just like a standard Normal distribution (solid line), but are slightly wider. The variability of a \(t\)-distribution depends on its degrees of freedom, which is calculated from the sample size of a study. (For a single sample of \(n\) observations or paired differences, the degrees of freedom is equal to \(n-1\).) Recall from previous classes that larger sample sizes tend to result in narrower sampling distributions. We see that here as well. The larger the sample size, the larger the degrees of freedom, the narrower the \(t\)-distribution. (In fact, a \(t\)-distribution with infinite degrees of freedom actually IS the standard Normal distribution!)

To find the standardized statistic for the paired differences we will use the following formula:

\[T = \frac{\bar{x}_d - \mu_0}{SE(\bar{x}_d)},\]
where the standard error of the sample mean difference is:

\[SE(\bar{x}_d)=\frac{s_d}{\sqrt{n}}.\]

To find the p-value we enter the value for the standardized statistic (T = 2.464) into the pt function in R. If you did not get his answer for question 7, double check your work. For a single sample or paired data, degrees of freedom are found by subtracting 1 from the sample size. You should therefore use \texttt{df} = \(n_d-1 = 70 - 1 = 69\) and \texttt{lower.tail\ =\ FALSE} to find the p-value.

To calculate a theory-based confidence interval for the paired mean difference, use the following formula:

\[\bar{x}_d\pm t^* \times SE(\bar{x}_d).\]
We will need to find the \(t^*\) multiplier using the function \texttt{qt()}. The code below will return the 95th percentile of the \(t\) distribution with \texttt{df} = \(n_d - 1 = 70 - 1 = 69\).

\subsection{COVID-19 and air pollution}\label{covid-19-and-air-pollution}}

In June 2020, the social distancing efforts and stay-at-home directives to help combat the spread of COVID-19 appeared to help `flatten the curve' across the United States, albeit at a high cost to many individuals and businesses. The impact of these measures, though, goes far beyond the infection and death rates from the disease. You may have seen images comparing air quality in large international cities like Rome, Milan, Wuhan, and New Delhi such as the one pictured in Figure \ref{fig:covid}, which seem to indicate, perhaps unsurprisingly, that fewer people driving and factories being shut down have reduced air pollutants.

Have high population-density US cities seen the same improved air quality conditions? To study this question, data were gathered from the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) AirData website which records the ozone (O3) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) values for cities across the US (US Environmental Protection Agency, n.d.). These measures are used to calculate an air quality index (AQI) score for each city each day of the year. Thirty-three of the most densely populated US cities were selected and the AQI score recorded for April 20, 2020 as well as the five-year median AQI score for April 20th (2015--2019). Note that higher AQI scores indicate worse air quality. A box plot of the differences in AQI scores for the 33 cities and a table of summary statistics are shown on the next page. Use Current - 5-year median as the order of subtraction.

To simulate the null distribution of paired sample mean differences we will use a bootstrapping method. Recall that the null distribution must be created under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true. Therefore, before bootstrapping, we will need to \emph{shift} each data point by the difference \(\mu_0 - \bar{x}_d\). This will ensure that the mean of the shifted data is \(\mu_0\) (rather than the mean of the original data, \(\bar{x}_d\)), and that the simulated null distribution will be centered at the null value.

  When analyzing paired data, the summary statistic is the `mean difference' NOT the `difference in means'\footnote{Technically, if we calculate the differences and then take the mean (mean difference), and we calculate the two means and then take the difference (difference in means), the value will be the same. However, the \emph{sampling variability} of the two statistics will differ, as we will see in Week 12.}. This terminology will be \emph{very} important in interpretations.

Profanity (language considered obscene or taboo) and society's attitude about its acceptableness is a highly debated topic, but does swearing serve a physiological purpose or function? Previous research has shown that swearing produces increased heart rates and higher levels of skin conductivity. It is theorized that since swearing provokes intense emotional responses, it acts as a distracter, allowing a person to withstand higher levels of pain. To explore the relationship between swearing and increased pain tolerance, researchers from Keele University (Staffordshire, UK) recruited 83 native English-speaking participants (Stephens and Robertson 2020). Each volunteer performed two trials holding a hand in an ice-water bath, once while repeating the ``f-word'' every three seconds, and once while repeating a neutral word (``table''). The order of the word to repeat was randomly assigned. Researchers recorded the length of time, in seconds, from the moment the participant indicated they were in pain until they removed their hand from the ice water for each trial. They hope to find evidence that pain tolerance is greater (longer times) when a person swears compared to when they say a neutral word, on average. Use Swear -- Neutral as the order of subtraction.

In this study, the null hypothesis states that swearing does not affect pain tolerance, or that the length of time a subject kept their hand in the water would be the same whether the patient was swearing or not.

We will use the \texttt{paired\_test()} function in R (in the \texttt{catstats} package) to simulate the null distribution of sample mean differences and compute a p-value.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{10}
\tightlist
\item
  When using the \texttt{paired\_test()} function, we need to enter the name of the data set, either the order of subtraction (if the data set has both measurements) or the name of the differences (if the data set contains them). We will also need to provide R with the observed mean difference, the direction of the alternative hypothesis, and the shift required in order to force the null hypothesis to be true. The name of the data set as shown above is \texttt{swearing\_diff} and the column of differences is called \texttt{differences}. What values should be entered for each of the following to create 1000 simulated samples?

\(n_1\)= sample size of group 1

\(n_2\) = sample size of group 2

\(\overline{x}\) = sample mean

\(s\) = sample standard deviation

\(\mu\) = population mean

\(\sigma\) = population standard deviation

General steps of a hypothesis test:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Frame the research question in terms of hypotheses.
\item
  Collect and summarize data using a test statistic.
\item
  Assume the null hypothesis is true, and simulate or mathematically model a null distribution for the test statistic.
\item
  Compare the observed test statistic to the null distribution to calculate a p-value.
\item
  Make a conclusion based on the p-value and write the conclusion in context.
\end{enumerate}

Parameter: a value summarizing a variable(s) for a population.

Statistic: a value summarizing a variable(s) for a sample.

Sampling distribution: plot of statistics from 1000s of samples of the same size taken from the same population.

Standard deviation of a statistic: the variability of statistics from 1000s of samples; how far, on average, each statistic is from the true value of the parameter.

Standard error of a statistic: estimated standard deviation of a statistic.

Hypothesis test: a process to determine how strong the evidence of an effect is. Also called a `significance test'.

Simulation-based method: Simulate lots of samples of size \(n\) under assumption of the null hypothesis, then find the proportion of the simulations that are at least as extreme as the observed sample statistic.

Theory-based method: Develop a mathematical model for the sampling distribution of the statistic under the null hypothesis and use the model to calculate the probability of the observed sample statistic (or one more extreme) occurring.

Null hypothesis (\(H_0\)): the skeptical perspective; no difference; no change; no effect; random chance; what the researcher hopes to prove is \textbf{wrong}.

Alternative hypothesis (\(H_A\)): the new perspective; a difference/increase/decrease; an effect; not random chance; what the researcher hopes to prove is \textbf{correct}.

Null value: the value of the parameter when we assume the null hypothesis is true (labeled as \(parameter_0\)).

Null distribution: the simulated or modeled distribution of statistics (sampling distribution) we would expect to occur if the null hypothesis is true.

P-value: probability of seeing the observed sample data, or something more extreme, assuming the null hypothesis is true.

\(\implies\) Lower the p-value the stronger the evidence AGAINST the null hypothesis and FOR the alternative hypothesis.

Decision: a determination of whether to reject or fail to reject a null hypothesis based on a p-value and a pre-set level of significance.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  If p-value \(\leq \alpha\), then reject \(H_0\).
\item
  If p-value \(> \alpha\), then fail to reject \(H_0\).
\end{itemize}

Significance level (\(\alpha\)): a threshold used to determine if a p-value provides enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis or not.

\rgi Common levels of \(\alpha\) include 0.01, 0.05, and 0.10.

Statistically significant: results are considered statistically significant if the p-value is below the significance level.

Confidence interval: a process to determine how large an effect is; a range of plausible values for the parameter. Also called `estimation'.

Margin of error: the value that is added to and subtracted from the sample statistic to create a confidence interval; half the width of a confidence interval.

Bootstrapping: the process of drawing with replacement \(n\) times from the original sample.

Bootstrapped resample: a random sample of size \(n\) from the original sample, selected with replacement.

Bootstrapped statistic: the statistic recorded from the bootstrapped resample.

Confidence level: how confident we are that the confidence interval will capture the parameter.

Bootstrap \(X\)\% confidence interval: (\((\frac{(1-X)}{2})^{th}\) percentile, \((X+(\frac{(1-X)}{2})^{th}\) percentile) of a bootstrap distribution.

Central Limit Theorem: For large sample sizes, the sampling distribution of a sample mean (or proportion) will be approximately normal (bell-shaped and symmetric).

\(t\)-distribution: A bell-shaped symmetric distribution, centered at 0, wider than the standard normal distribution.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The variability in a \(t\)-distribution depends on the sample size (used to calculate degrees of freedom --- df for short).
\item
  The \(t\)-distribution gets closer to the standard normal distribution as df increases.
\end{itemize}

Degrees of freedom (df): describes the variability of the \(t\)-distribution.

T-score: the name for a standardized statistic which is compared to a \(t\)-distribution.

Example: Fifty-one (51) college students volunteered to look at impacts on memorization, specifically if putting letters into recognizable patterns (like FBI, CIA, EDA, CDC, etc.) would increase the number letters memorized. The college students were randomly assigned to either a recognizable or non-recognizable letter group. After a period of study time, the number of letters memorized was collect on each study. Is there evidence that putting letters into recognizable letter groups improve memory?

Why should we treat this as two independent groups rather than paired data?

Example:

Every year, orange and black monarch butterflies migrate from their summer breeding grounds in the US and Canada to mountain forests in central Mexico, where they hibernate for the winter. Due to abnormal weather patterns and drought affecting monarch habitats and feeding grounds, the population of monarch butterflies is estimated to have decreased by 53\% from the 2018-2019 wintering season to the 2019-2020 wintering season (WWF, 2020). While conservationists often resort to captive-rearing with the goal of raising biologically indistinct individuals for release into the wild, tagging studies have shown that captive-reared monarchs have lower migratory success compared to wild monarchs. For this study, the researchers raised 67 monarchs (descended from wild monarchs) from eggs to maturity and then compared them to a group of 40 wild-caught monarchs. The researchers want to explore whether the maximum grip strength (how many Newtons a butterfly exerts at the moment of release when gently tugged from a mesh-covered perch) differs between captive-reared and wild-caught monarchs. Use Captive -- Wild for order of subtraction.

\subsection{Behavior and Performance}\label{behavior-and-performance}}

A study in the Academy of Management Journal (Porath 2017) investigated how rude behaviors influence a victim's task performance. Randomly selected college students enrolled in a management course were randomly assigned to one of two experimental conditions: rudeness condition (45 students) and control group (53 students). Each student was asked to write down as many uses for a brick as possible in five minutes; this value (total number of uses) was used as a performance measure for each student, where higher values indicate better performance. During this time another individual showed up late for class. For those students in the rudeness condition, the facilitator displayed rudeness by berating the students in general for being irresponsible and unprofessional (due to the late-arriving person). No comments were made about the late-arriving person for students in the control group. Is there evidence that the average performance score for students in the rudeness condition is lower than for students in the control group? Use the order of subtraction of rudeness -- control.

The Triple Crown of ``Thru'' hiking consists of hiking the Appalachian Trail, the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT), and the Continental Divide Trail (CDT). Each year halfwayanywhere.com conducts a survey to better understand the people who hike these trails. One variable which is queried in the survey is the pre-hike ``base weight'' of a hiker's pack which is the total weight of gear without food, water, and worn gear. The 131 hikers surveyed who completed the CDT had a mean base weight of 15.266 lbs (sd = 5.128 lbs). The 484 hikers surveyed who completed the PCT had a mean base weight of 17.837 lbs (sd = 7.823 lbs). Is there a difference in average base weight for PCT hikers and CDT hikers? Use order of subtraction CDT - PCT.

The sampling distribution for \(\bar{x}_1-\bar{x}_2\) can be modeled using a normal distribution when certain conditions are met.

Conditions for the sampling distribution of \(\bar{x}_1-\bar{x}_2\) to follow an approximate normal distribution:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Independence}: The sample's observations are independent
\item
  \textbf{Normality}: Each sample should be approximately normal or have a large sample size. For \emph{each} sample:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    \(n < 30\): If the sample size \(n\) is less than 30 and there are no clear outliers in the data, then we typically assume the data come from a nearly normal distribution to satisfy the condition.
  \item
    \(n \ge 30\): If the sample size \(n\) is at least 30 and there are no particularly extreme outliers, then we typically assume the sampling distribution of \(\bar{x}\) is nearly normal, even if the underlying distribution of individual observations is not.
  \item
    \(n \geq 100\): If the sample size \(n\) is at least 100 (regardless of the presence of skew or outliers), we typically assume the sampling distribution of \(\bar{x}\) is nearly normal, even if the underlying distribution of individual observations is not.

\(\beta_0\): population \(y\)-intercept

\(\beta_1\): population slope

\(\rho\): population correlation

\(b_0\): sample \(y\)-intercept

\(b_1\): sample slope

\(r\): sample correlation

Scatterplot: displays two quantitative variables; one dot = two measurements (\(x\), \(y\)) on one observational unit.

Four characteristics of a scatterplot:
\setstretch{1}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{Form}: pattern of the dots plotted. Is the trend generally linear (you can fit a straight line to the data) or non-linear?\\
\item
  \emph{Strength}: how closely do the points follow a trend? Very closely (strong)? No pattern (weak)?\\
\item
  \emph{Direction}: as the \(x\) values increase, do the \(y\)-values tend to increase (positive) or decrease (negative)?\\
\item
  Unusual observations or \emph{outliers}: points that do not fit the overall pattern of the data.
\end{itemize}

\setstretch{1.25}

Least squares regression line: \(\hat{y} = b_0+b_1 \times x\), where \(b_0\) is the sample \(y\)-intercept (the estimate for the \texttt{(Intercept)} row in the R regression output), and \(b_1\) is the sample slope (the estimate for the \texttt{x-variable\_name} row in the R).

Sample slope interpretation: a 1 unit increase in the \emph{x} variable is associated with a \(|b_1|\) unit \emph{predicted} increase/decrease in the \emph{y}-variable.

General steps of a hypothesis test:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Frame the research question in terms of hypotheses.
\item
  Collect and summarize data using a test statistic.
\item
  Assume the null hypothesis is true, and simulate or mathematically model a null distribution for the test statistic.
\item
  Compare the observed test statistic to the null distribution to calculate a p-value.
\item
  Make a conclusion based on the p-value and write the conclusion in context.
\end{enumerate}

Parameter: a value summarizing a variable(s) for a population.

Statistic: a value summarizing a variable(s) for a sample.

Sampling distribution: plot of statistics from 1000s of samples of the same size taken from the same population.

Standard deviation of a statistic: the variability of statistics from 1000s of samples; how far, on average, each statistic is from the true value of the parameter.

Standard error of a statistic: estimated standard deviation of a statistic.

Hypothesis test: a process to determine how strong the evidence of an effect is. Also called a `significance test'.

Simulation-based method: Simulate lots of samples of size \(n\) under assumption of the null hypothesis, then find the proportion of the simulations that are at least as extreme as the observed sample statistic.

Theory-based method: Develop a mathematical model for the sampling distribution of the statistic under the null hypothesis and use the model to calculate the probability of the observed sample statistic (or one more extreme) occurring.

Null hypothesis (\(H_0\)): the skeptical perspective; no difference; no change; no effect; random chance; what the researcher hopes to prove is \textbf{wrong}.

Alternative hypothesis (\(H_A\)): the new perspective; a difference/increase/decrease; an effect; not random chance; what the researcher hopes to prove is \textbf{correct}.

Null value: the value of the parameter when we assume the null hypothesis is true (labeled as \(parameter_0\)).

Null distribution: the simulated or modeled distribution of statistics (sampling distribution) we would expect to occur if the null hypothesis is true.

P-value: probability of seeing the observed sample data, or something more extreme, assuming the null hypothesis is true.

\(\implies\) Lower the p-value the stronger the evidence AGAINST the null hypothesis and FOR the alternative hypothesis.

Decision: a determination of whether to reject or fail to reject a null hypothesis based on a p-value and a pre-set level of significance.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  If p-value \(\leq \alpha\), then reject \(H_0\).
\item
  If p-value \(> \alpha\), then fail to reject \(H_0\).
\end{itemize}

Significance level (\(\alpha\)): a threshold used to determine if a p-value provides enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis or not.

\rgi Common levels of \(\alpha\) include 0.01, 0.05, and 0.10.

Statistically significant: results are considered statistically significant if the p-value is below the significance level.

Confidence interval: a process to determine how large an effect is; a range of plausible values for the parameter. Also called `estimation'.

Margin of error: the value that is added to and subtracted from the sample statistic to create a confidence interval; half the width of a confidence interval.

Bootstrapping: the process of drawing with replacement \(n\) times from the original sample.

Bootstrapped resample: a random sample of size \(n\) from the original sample, selected with replacement.

Bootstrapped statistic: the statistic recorded from the bootstrapped resample.

Confidence level: how confident we are that the confidence interval will capture the parameter.

Bootstrap \(X\)\% confidence interval: (\((\frac{(1-X)}{2})^{th}\) percentile, \((X+(\frac{(1-X)}{2})^{th}\) percentile) of a bootstrap distribution

\(t\)-distribution: A bell-shaped symmetric distribution, centered at 0, wider than the standard normal distribution.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The variability in a \(t\)-distribution depends on the sample size (used to calculate degrees of freedom --- df for short).
\item
  The \(t\)-distribution gets closer to the standard normal distribution as df increases.
\end{itemize}

Degrees of freedom (df): describes the variability of the \(t\)-distribution.

T-score: the name for a standardized statistic which is compared to a \(t\)-distribution.

For this example, we will look at the most recent 100 measurements of salt water salinity (measured in PSUs or practical salinity units) and the temperature of the ocean measured in degrees Celsius. Is there evidence that water temperature tends to decrease with higher levels of salinity.

It is a generally accepted fact that the more carats a diamond has, the more expensive that diamond will be. The question is, how much more expensive? Data on thousands of diamonds were collected for this data set. We will only look at one type of cut (``Ideal'') and diamonds less than 1 carat.

\subsection{Crocodylian Body Size}\label{crocodylian-body-size}}

Much research surrounds using measurements of animals to estimate body-size of extinct animals. Many challenges exist in making accurate estimates for extinct crocodylians. The term crocodylians refers to all members of the family Crocodylidae (``true'' crocodiles), family Alligatoridae (alligators and caimans) and family Gavialidae (gharial, Tomistoma). The researchers in this study (O'Brien 2019) state, ``Among extinct crocodylians and their precursors (e.g., suchians), several methods have been developed to predict body size from suites of hard-tissue proxies. Nevertheless, many have limited applications due to the disparity of some major suchian groups and biases in the fossil record. Here, we test the utility of head width (HW) as a broadly applicable body-size estimator in living and fossil suchians.'' Is there evidence that head width is a good predictor of body size for crocodylians?

Let's start by thinking about how one simulation would be created on the null distribution using cards. First, we would write the values for the response variable, total length, on each card. Next, we would shuffle these \(y\) values while keeping the \(x\) values (explanatory variable) in the same order. Then, find the line of regression for the shuffled \((x, y)\) pairs and calculate either the slope or correlation of the shuffled sample.

We will use the \texttt{regression\_test()} function in R (in the \texttt{catstats} package) to simulate the null distribution of shuffled slopes (or shuffled correlations) and compute a p-value. We will need to enter the response variable name and the explanatory variable name for the formula, the data set name (identified above as \texttt{croc}), the summary measure for the test (either slope or correlation), number of repetitions, the sample statistic (value of slope or correlation), and the direction of the alternative hypothesis.

The response variable name is \texttt{TL\_cm} and the explanatory variable name is \texttt{HW\_cm} for these data.

\subsection{Golf driving distance}\label{golf-driving-distance}}

In golf the goal is to complete a hole with as few strokes as possible. A long driving distance to start a hole can help minimize the strokes necessary to complete the hole, as long as that drive stays on the fairway. Data was collecting on 354 PGA and LPGA players in 2008 ({``Average Driving Distance and Fairway Accuracy''} 2008). For each player, the average driving distance (yards), fairway accuracy (percentage), and sex was measured. Use these data to assess, ``Does a professional golfer give up accuracy when they hit the ball farther?''

When performing inference on a least squares line, the follow conditions are generally required:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{Independent observations} (for both simulation-based and theory-based methods): individual data points must be independent.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Check this assumption by investigating the sampling method and determining if the observational units are related in any way.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \emph{Linearity} (for both simulation-based and theory-based methods): the data should follow a linear trend.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Check this assumption by examining the scatterplot of the two variables, and a scatterplot of the residuals (on the \(y\)-axis) versus the fitted values (on the \(x\)-axis). The pattern in the residual plot should display a horizontal line.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \emph{Constant variability} (for theory-based methods only): the variability of points around the least squares line remains roughly constant

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Check this assumption by examining a scatterplot of the residuals (on the \(y\)-axis) versus the fitted values (on the \(x\)-axis). The variability in the residuals around zero should be approximately the same for all fitted values.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \emph{Nearly normal residuals} (for theory-based methods only: residuals must be nearly normal.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Check this assumption by examining a histogram of the residuals, which should appear approximately normal\footnote{A better plot for checking the normality assumption is called a \emph{normal quantile-quantile plot} (or QQ-plot). However, this type of plot will be covered in a future course}.

  To check the validity conditions for using theory-based methods we must use the residual diagnostic plots to check for normality of residuals and constant variability, and the scatterplot to check for linearity.
\item
  To interpret a confidence interval for the slope, think about how to interpret the sample slope and use that information in the confidence interval interpretation for slope.
\item
  Use the explanatory variable row in the linear model R output to obtain the slope estimate (\texttt{estimate} column) and standard error of the slope (\texttt{Std.\ Error} column) to calculate the standardized slope, or T-score. The calculated T-score should match the \texttt{t\ value} column in the explanatory variable row. The standardized slope tells the number of standard errors the observed slope is above or below 0.
\item
  The explanatory variable row in the linear model R output provides a \textbf{two-sided} p-value under the \texttt{Pr(\textgreater{}\textbar{}t\textbar{})} column.

  The standardized slope is compared to a \(t\)-distribution with \(n-2\) degrees of freedom in order to obtain a p-value. The \(t\)-distribution with \(n-2\) degrees of freedom is also used to find the appropriate multiplier for a given confidence level.

\subsection{Big Mac Index}\label{big-mac-index}}

Can the relative cost of a Big Mac across different countries be used to predict the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per person for that country? The GDP per person and the adjusted dollar equivalent to purchase a Big Mac was found on a random sample of 55 countries in January of 2022. The cost of a Big Mac in each country was adjusted to US dollars based on current exchange rates. Is there evidence of a positive relationship between Big Mac cost and the GDP per person?

Upload and open the R script file for Week 13 lab. Upload and import the csv file, \texttt{big\_mac\_adjusted\_index\_S22.csv}. Enter the name of the data set (see the environment tab) for datasetname in the R script file in line 9. Highlight and run lines 1--9 to load the data.

Use the provided data set from the Islands (ExamReviewData.csv) and the appropriate Exam 1 Review R script file to answer the following questions. Each adult (\textgreater21) islander was selected at random from all adult islanders. Note that some islanders choose not to participate in the study. These islanders that did not consent to be in the study are removed from the dataset before analysis. Variables and their descriptions are listed below. Here is some more information about some of the variables collected. Music type (classical or heavy metal) was randomly assigned to the Islanders. Time to complete the puzzle cube was measured after listening to music for each Islander. Heart rate and blood glucose levels were both measured before and then after drinking a caffeinated beverage.

\section{Golden Ticket to Descriptive and Inferential Statistical Methods}\label{golden-ticket-to-descriptive-and-inferential-statistical-methods}}

In this course, we have covered descriptive (summary statistics and plots) and inferential (hypothesis tests and confidence intervals) methods for five different scenarios:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  one categorical response variable
\item
  two categorical variables
\item
  one quantitative response variable or paired differences in a quantitative variable
\item
  two quantitative variables
\item
  one quantitative response variable and one categorical explanatory variable
\end{itemize}

The ``golden ticket'' shown on the next page presents a visual summary of the similarities and differences across these five scenarios.
