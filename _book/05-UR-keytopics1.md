## Unit 1 Review

## Key Topics Exam 1

* Identify the observational units

* Identify the variables

* Identify the type of variable (whether each variable is categorical or quantitative)

* Identify if a given value is a statistic or a parameter.  Identify the appropriate notation?

* Identify and interpret the summary statistic

* Identify the target population

* Identify the types of sampling bias (response, non-response, selection, none) 

* Identify the type(s) of graph(s) that could be used to plot the given variable(s).

* Identify the variable(s) plotted in provided graphs.

* Write the parameter of interest in context of the problem.

* Write the null and alternative hypotheses in both words and notation

* Calculate the summary statistic

* Use the null distribution to find the p-value of the test

* Interpret the p-value in context of the problem

* Write a conclusion to the research question in context of the problem

* Determine which group of observation units the results can be generalized to 

* Use the bootstrap distribution to find the confidence interval

* Interpret the confidence **interval** in context of the problem

* Interpret the confidence **level** in context of the problem

* Calculate and interpret the standardized statistic 

* Calculate and interpret the standard error of the statistic assuming the null hypothesis is true

* Calculate the confidence interval using theory-based methods

* Calculate the standard error of the statistic not assuming the null hypothesis is true

* Determine if the conditions are met to use theory-based methods
