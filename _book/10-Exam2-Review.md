# Group Exam 2 Review

Use the provided data set from the Islands (ExamReviewData.csv) and the appropriate Exam 1 Review R script file to answer the following questions. Each adult (>21) islander was selected at random from all adult islanders. Note that some islanders choose not to participate in the study.  These islanders that did not consent to be in the study are removed from the dataset before analysis.  Variables and their descriptions are listed below. 

| **Variable** 	| **Description** |
|----	|-------------	|
| `Island` | Name of Island that the Islander resides on |
| `City` | Name of City in which the Islander resides |
| `Population` | Population of the City |
| `Name` | Name of Islander |
| `Consent` | Whether the Islander consented to be in the study |
| `Gender` | Gender of Islander (M = male, F = Female) |
| `Age` | Age of Islander |
| `Married` | Marital status of Islander |
| `Smoking_Status` | Whether the Islander is a current smoker |
| `Children` | Whether the Islander has children |
| `weight_kg` | Weight measured in kg |
| `height_cm` | Height measured in cm |
| `respiratory_rate` | Breaths per minute |
| `Type_of_Music` | Music type (Classical or Heavy Medal) Islander was randomly assigned to listen to |
| `After_PuzzleCube` | Time to complete puzzle cube (minutes) after listening to assigned music |
| `Education_Level` | Highest level of education completed |
| `Balance_Test` | Time balanced measured in seconds with eyes closed |
| `Blood_Glucose_before` | Level of blood glucose (mg/dL) before consuming assigned drink |
| `Heart_Rate_before` | Heart rate (bpm) before consuming assigned drink |
| `Blood_Glucose_after` | Level of blood glucose (mg/dL) after consuming assigned drink |
| `Heart_Rate_after` | Heart rate (bpm) after consuming assigned drink |
| `Diff_Heart_Rate` | Difference in heart rate (bpm) for Before - After consuming assigned drink |
| `Diff_Blood_Glucose` | Difference in blood glucose (mg/dL) for Before - After consuming assigned drink |
