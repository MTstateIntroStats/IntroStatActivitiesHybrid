## Activity 13:  Body Temperature

\setstretch{1}

### Learning outcomes

* Given a research question involving a quantitative variable, construct the null and alternative hypotheses
  in words and using appropriate statistical symbols.
  
* Describe and perform a theory-based hypothesis test for a single mean.

* Interpret and evaluate a p-value for a theory-based hypothesis test for a single mean.

### Terminology review

In today's activity, we will analyze quantitative data using theory-based methods. Some terms covered in this activity are:

* Normality

* $t$-distribution

* Degrees of freedom

* $T$-score

To review these concepts, see Chapters 11 and 17 in the textbook.

### Body Temperature

It has long been reported that the mean body temperature of adults is $98.6^{\circ}$F.  There have been a few articles that challenge this assertion. [@luetkemeier2017]  In 2018, a sample of 52 Stat 216 undergraduates were asked to report their body temperature.  Is there evidence that body temperatures of adults differ from the known temperature of $98.6^{\circ}$F?

In general, the sampling distribution for a sample mean, $\bar{x}$, based on a sample of size $n$ from a population with a true mean $\mu$ and true standard deviation $\sigma$ can be modeled using a Normal distribution when certain conditions are met.

Conditions for the sampling distribution of $\bar{x}$ to follow an approximate Normal distribution:

* **Independence**: the sampleâ€™s observations are independent, e.g., are from a simple random sample. (*Remember*: This also must be true to use simulation methods!)

* **Normality Condition**: either the sample observations come from a normally distributed population or we have a large enough sample size.  To check this condition, use the following rules of thumb:

    - $n < 30$: If the sample size $n$ is less than 30 and the distribution of the data is approximately normal with no clear outliers in the data, then we typically assume the data come from a nearly normal distribution to satisfy the condition.

    - $30 \leq n < 100$: If the sample size $n$ is between 30 and 100 and there are no particularly extreme outliers in the data, then we typically assume the sampling distribution of $\bar{x}$ is nearly normal, even if the underlying distribution of individual observations is not.
    
    - $n \geq 100$: If the sample size $n$ is at least 100 (regardless of the presence of skew or outliers), we typically assume the sampling distribution of $\bar{x}$ is nearly normal, even if the underlying distribution of individual observations is not.
 

Like we saw in Chapter **5**, we will not know the values of the parameters and must use the sample data to estimate them.  Unlike with proportions, in which we only needed to estimate the population proportion, $\pi$, quantitative sample data must be used to estimate both a population mean $\mu$ and a population standard deviation $\sigma$. This additional uncertainty will require us to use a theoretical distribution that is just a bit wider than the standard Normal distribution. Enter the **$t$-distribution**!


As you can seen from Figure \@ref(fig:tdist), the $t$-distributions (dashed and dotted lines) are centered at 0 just like a standard Normal distribution (solid line), but are slightly wider.  The variability of a $t$-distribution depends on its degrees of freedom, which is calculated from the sample size of a study.  (For a single sample of $n$ observations or paired differences, the degrees of freedom is equal to $n-1$.) Recall from previous classes that larger sample sizes tend to result in narrower sampling distributions.  We see that here as well.  The larger the sample size, the larger the degrees of freedom, the narrower the $t$-distribution.  (In fact, a $t$-distribution with infinite degrees of freedom actually IS the standard Normal distribution!)

#### Summarize and visualize the data {-}

The following code is used to create a boxplot of the data.

* Download the R script file upload to the R studio server.

* Open the R script file and highlight and run lines 1--14.


``` r
bodytemp <- read.csv("https://math.montana.edu/courses/s216/data/normal_temperature.csv")
bodytemp %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Temp))+
  geom_boxplot()+
  labs(title="Boxplot of Body Temperatures for Stat 216 Students",
       x = "body temperature (*F)") +
        theme(axis.text.y = element_blank(), 
          axis.ticks.y = element_blank()) # Removes y-axis ticks
```



\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{06-A13-quantitative_theory_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-1-1} \end{center}

* Highlight and run lines 17 - 18 to get the summary statistics for the variable `Temp`.


``` r
bodytemp %>% 
  summarise(favstats(Temp))
```

```
#>    min     Q1 median   Q3 max     mean        sd  n missing
#> 1 97.2 97.675   98.2 98.7 100 98.28462 0.6823789 52       0

#### Use statistical inferential methods to draw inferences from the data {-}


To find the standardized statistic for the mean we will use the following formula:

$$T = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu_0}{SE(\bar{x})},$$
where the standard error of the sample mean is:

$$SE(\bar{x})=\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}.$$

7.  Calculate the standard error of the sample mean.

8. Interpret the standard error in context of the study.

10. We model a single mean with a $t$-distribution with $n-1$ degrees of freedom.  Calculate the degrees of freedom for this study and use it to fill in the blank in the title of the $t$-distribution displayed below.

11. Mark the value of the standardized statistic on the $t$-distribution and illustrate how the p-value is found.

\newpage

To find the p-value for the theory-based test in R: 

* Enter the value for the standardized statistic for `xx` in the `pt` function.  

* Enter the degrees of freedom for `yy` in the `pt` function.

* Highlight and run line 24.


``` r
pt(xx, df=yy, lower.tail=FALSE)
```

12.  What does this p-value mean, in the context of the study?  Hint: it is the probability of what...assuming what?

14. Can we generalize the results of the study to all adults? Explain your answer.

### Take-home messages

1.  In order to use theory-based methods for a quantitative variable, the independent observational units and normality conditions must be met.  

2.  In order to find a theory-based p-value, we use R to calculate the area under a $t$-distribution with $n - 1$ degrees of freedom (df) that is at or more extreme than the observed $T$-score. To find a two-sided p-value using theory-based methods we need to multiply the one-sided p-value by 2.  

3.  A $t^*$ multiplier is found by obtaining the bounds of the middle X% (X being the desired confidence level) of a $t$-distribution with $n - 1$ df.
