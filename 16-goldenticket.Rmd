## Golden Ticket to Descriptive and Inferential Statistical Methods

In this course, we have covered descriptive (summary statistics and plots) and inferential (hypothesis tests and confidence intervals) methods for five different scenarios:

* one categorical response variable (Module 3 & 4)
* one quantitative response variable (Module 6 & 7) or paired differences in a quantitative variable (Module 13)
* two categorical variables (Module 8 & 9)
* one quantitative response variable and one categorical explanatory variable (Module 11)
* two quantitative variables (Module 12)


The "golden ticket" shown on the next page presents a visual summary of the similarities and differences across these five scenarios.
