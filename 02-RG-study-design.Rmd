#### Notes {-}

Ideally, how should we sample cases from our target population?  Using what sampling method? 
\rgs

##### Notes on types of sampling bias {-}

* Someone must first be _chosen_ to be in a study and refuse to participate in order to have **non-response bias**.

* There must be a valid reason for someone to lie or be untruthful to justify saying **response bias** is present.  Yes, anyone could lie at any time to any question.  Response bias is when those lies are predictable and systematic based on outside influences.

True or False: Convenience sampling tends to result in non-response bias.

True or False: Volunteer sampling tends to result in response bias.

True or False: Random sampling helps to resolve selection bias, but has no impact on non-response or response bias.

### Section 2.2 \& 2.3: Study Design {-}

#### Reminders from Section 1.2 {-}

**Explanatory variable**: The variable researchers think _may be_ affecting the other variable.  What the researchers control/assign in an experiment.  If comparing groups, the explanatory variable puts the observational units into groups.

**Response variable**: The variable researchers think _may be_ influenced by the other variable.  This variable is always observed, never controlled or assigned.

True or False: Observational studies can show an association between two variables, but cannot determine a causal relationship.
	
True or False: In order for an experiment to be valid, a placebo must be used.

True or False: If random sampling of the target population is used, and no other types of bias are suspected, results from the sample can be generalized to the entire target population.

True or False: If random sampling of the target population is used, and no other types of bias are suspected, results from the sample can be inferred as a causal relationship between the explanatory and response variables.
