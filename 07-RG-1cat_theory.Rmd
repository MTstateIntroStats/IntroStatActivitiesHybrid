$\overline{x}$ = sample mean

$\mu$ = population mean

$\sigma$ = population standard deviation

General steps of a hypothesis test:

1. Frame the research question in terms of hypotheses.

2. Collect and summarize data using a test statistic.
	
3. Assume the null hypothesis is true, and simulate or mathematically model a null distribution for the test statistic.

4. Compare the observed test statistic to the null distribution to calculate a p-value.

5. Make a conclusion based on the p-value and write the conclusion in context.

Parameter: a value summarizing a variable(s) for a population.

Statistic: a value summarizing a variable(s) for a sample.

Hypothesis test: a process to determine how strong the evidence of an effect is. Also called a ‘significance test’.

Simulation-based method: Simulate lots of samples of size $n$ under assumption of the null hypothesis, then find the proportion of the simulations that are at least as extreme as the observed sample statistic.

Theory-based method: Develop a mathematical model for the sampling distribution of the statistic under the null hypothesis and use the model to calculate the probability of the observed sample statistic (or one more extreme) occurring.

Null hypothesis ($H_0$): the skeptical perspective; no difference; no change; no effect; random chance; what the researcher hopes to prove is **wrong**.

Alternative hypothesis ($H_A$): the new perspective; a difference/increase/decrease; an effect; not random chance; what the researcher hopes to prove is **correct**.

Null value: the value of the parameter when we assume the null hypothesis is true (labeled as $parameter_0$).

P-value: probability of seeing the observed sample data, or something more extreme, assuming the null hypothesis is true.

$\implies$ Lower the p-value the stronger the evidence AGAINST the null hypothesis and FOR the alternative hypothesis.

Significance level ($\alpha$): a threshold used to determine if a p-value provides enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis or not.

\rgi Common levels of $\alpha$ include 0.01, 0.05, and 0.10.

Statistically significant: results are considered statistically significant if the p-value is below the significance level.

Confidence interval: a process to determine how large an effect is; a range of plausible values for the parameter. Also called 'estimation'.

### R coding {-}

##### Calculating normal probabilities {-}

When using the `pnorm()` R function, you will need to enter values for the arguments `mean`, `sd`, and `q` to match the question.

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
pnorm(mean = mu, sd = sigma, q = x, lower.tail = TRUE)
```

This function will return the proportion of the N(`mu`,`sigma`) distribution which is *below* the value `x`.

Example: `pnorm(mean = 5, sd = 2, q = 3, lower.tail = TRUE)` will give us the proportion of a N(5,2) distribution which is below 3, which equals 0.159:
 
```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
pnorm(mean = 5, sd = 2, q = 3, lower.tail = TRUE)
```

Changing to `lower.tail = FALSE` will give the proportion of the distribution which is *above* the value `x`.

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
pnorm(mean = 5, sd = 2, q = 3, lower.tail = FALSE)
```

##### Displaying normal probabilities {-} 

When using the `normTail()` R function, you will need to enter values for the arguments `m`, `s`, and `L` (or `U`) to match the question.

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
normTail(m = mu, s = sigma, L = x)
```

This function (in the `openintro` package) will plot a N(`mu`, `sigma`) distribution and shade the area that is below the value `x`.

Example: `normTail(m = 5, s = 2, L = 3)` creates the plot pictured below.

```{r normgt3, fig.cap="", out.width="60%", echo=FALSE}
#include_graphics("images/Norm_greaterthan_3.png")
normTail(m = 5, s = 2, L = 3)
```

Changing `L` to `U` will shade the area *above* `x`.  

Example: `normTail(m = 5, s = 2, U = 3)` plots a N(5,2) distribution with the area above 3 shaded.

##### Calculating normal percentiles {-}

When using the `qnorm()` R function, you will need to enter values for the arguments `mean`, `sd`, and `p` to match the question.

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
qnorm(mean = mu, sd = sigma, p = x, lower.tail = TRUE)
```

This function will return the value on the N(`mu`, `sigma`) distribution which has `x` area of the distribution *below* it.

Example:  `qnorm(mean = 5, sd = 2, p = 0.159, lower.tail = TRUE)` will give us the value on a N(5,2) distribution which has 0.159 (15.9%) of the distribution below it, which equals 3 (from the R output above).

Changing to `lower.tail = FALSE` will give the value which has `x` area of the distribution *above* it.

We would recommend you work through each of the examples in Section 5.2.4 using R.

\rgi Also called a ‘significance test’.

Theory-based method: Develop a mathematical model for the sampling distribution of the statistic under the null hypothesis and use the model to calculate the probability of the observed sample statistic (or one more extreme) occurring.

$\implies$ Lower the p-value the stronger the evidence AGAINST the null hypothesis and FOR the alternative hypothesis.

Decision: a determination of whether to 'reject' or 'fail to reject' a null hypothesis based on a p-value and a pre-set level of significance.

Significance level ($\alpha$): a threshold used to determine if a p-value provides enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis or not.

\rgi Common levels of $\alpha$ include 0.01, 0.05, and 0.10.

Statistically significant: results are considered statistically significant if the p-value is below the significance level.

Central Limit Theorem: For large sample sizes, the sampling distribution of a sample proportion (or mean) will be approximately normal (bell-shaped and symmetric).

Confidence interval: a process to determine how large an effect is; a range of plausible values for the parameter; also called 'estimation'.

Margin of error: the value that is added to and subtracted from the sample statistic to create a confidence interval; half the width of a confidence interval.
