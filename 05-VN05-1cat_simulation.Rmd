### Hypothesis Testing - Video Chapter9 {-}

Purpose of a hypothesis test:

* Use data collected on a sample to give information about the population.

* Determines __________________ of _____________________ of an effect

General steps of a hypothesis test

1.	Write a research question and hypotheses.

2.	Collect data and calculate a summary statistic.

3.	Model a sampling distribution which assumes the null hypothesis is true.

4.	Calculate a p-value.

5.	Draw conclusions based on a p-value.

### Hypothesis Testing/Justice System {-}

\setstretch{1.5}

* Two possible outcomes if the observed statistic is unusual:

    - Strong evidence against __________________ -> ____________________
    
    - Not enough evidence against _____________________ -> ______________________

* Always written about the __________________ (population)

\setstretch{1}

#### Null hypothesis {-}

* Skeptical perspective, no difference, no effect, random chance

* What the researcher hopes is _______________.

Notation:

\vspace{0.2in}

#### Alternative hypothesis {-}

* New perspective, a chance, a difference, an effect

* What the researcher hopes is ________________.

### Simulation vs. Theory-based Methods {-}

#### Simulation-based method {-}

\setstretch{1.5}

Creation of the null distribution

* Simulate many samples assuming 

\vspace{0.2in}

* Find the proportion of ___________________ at least as extreme as the observed sample ____________

* The null distribution estimates the sample to sample variability expected in the population

\setstretch{1}


#### Theory-based method {-}

* Use a mathematical model to determine a distribution under the null hypothesis

* Compare the observed sample statistic to the model to calculate a probability 

* *Theory-based methods will be discussed in the next module*

#### P-value {-}

\setstretch{1.5}

* What does the p-value measure?

    * Probability of observing the sample ___________________ or more __________ 
assuming the ________ hypothesis is __________.
    
* How much evidence does the p-value provide against the null hypothesis?

\rgi \rgi - The __________________the p-value, the ___________________ the evidence against the null hypothesis.
    
* Write a conclusion based on the p-value.

\rgi \rgi - Answers the ________________ question.

### One proportion test {-}

* Reminder: review summary measures and plots discussed in the Week 3 material and Chapter 4 of the textbook.

* The summary measure for a single categorical variable is a ______________.


Notation:

- Population proportion: 

- Sample proportion:

Parameter of Interest:  

* Include:
 
    * Reference of the population (true, long-run, population, all)
	
	* Summary measure

	* Context
	   
	    * Observational units/cases
	   
	    * Response variable (and explanatory variable if present)
	       
	        * If the response variable is categorical, define a ‘success’ in context

#### Hypothesis testing {-}

Conditions:

* Independence:

\vspace{0.3in}

Null hypothesis assumes “no effect”, “no difference”, “nothing interesting happening”, etc.

\rgi Always of form:  “parameter” = null value

$H_0:$

\vspace{0.5in}

$H_A:$

\vspace{0.5in}

* Research question determines the direction of the alternative hypothesis.

Video 14.1 Example: A 2007 study published in the Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology Journal was titled “Why do blue-eyed men prefer blue-eyed women?” [@laeng2007] In this study, conducted in Norway, 114 volunteer heterosexual blue-eyed males rated the attractiveness of 120 pictures of females.  The researchers recorded which eye-color (blue, green, or brown) was rated the highest, on average.  In the sample, 51 of the volunteers rated the blue-eyed women the most attractive.  Do blue-eyed heterosexual men tend to find blue-eyed women the most attractive?

Parameter of interest:

\vspace{0.5in}

Write the null and alternative hypotheses for the blue-eyed study:

<!-- In words:  -->

<!-- $H_0:$ -->

<!-- \vspace{0.45in} -->

<!-- $H_A:$ -->

<!-- \vspace{0.45in} -->

In notation:

\vspace{1mm}

$H_0:$

\vspace{0.2in}

$H_A:$

\vspace{0.2in}

Statistic: 

\vspace{0.4in}

Is the independence condition met to analyze these data using a simulation-based approach? 

\vspace{0.2in}

\newpage

#### Simulation-based method {-}

* Simulate many samples assuming $H_0: \pi = \pi_0$

    * Create a spinner with that represents the null value

    * Spin the spinner $n$ times

    * Calculate and plot the simulated sample proportion from each simulation

    * Repeat 1000 times (simulations) to create the null distribution

    * Find the proportion of simulations at least as extreme as $\hat{p}$

```{r, echo=TRUE}
set.seed(216)
one_proportion_test(probability_success = 0.333, # Null hypothesis value
          sample_size = 114, # Enter sample size
          number_repetitions = 1000, # Enter number of simulations
          as_extreme_as = 0.447, # Observed statistic
          direction = "greater", # Specify direction of alternative hypothesis
          summary_measure = "proportion") # Reporting proportion or number of successes?
```

Explain why the null distribution is centered at the value of approximately 0.333:

\vspace{0.5in}

Interpretation of the p-value:

* Statement about probability or proportion of samples

* Statistic (summary measure and value)
    
* Direction of the alternative 
    
* Null hypothesis (in context) 

\vspace{0.8in}

\newpage

Conclusion: 

* Amount of evidence
    
* Parameter of interest 
    
* Direction of the alternative hypothesis

\vspace{0.6in}

Generalization:

* Can the results of the study be generalized to the target population?

### Confidence interval - Video Chapter10 {-}

\rgi $\text{statistic} \pm \text{margin of error}$

Vocabulary:

* Point estimate:

\vspace{0.3in}

* Margin of error:

\vspace{0.3in}

\setstretch{1.5}

Purpose of a confidence interval

* To give an ____________________ ___________________ for the parameter of interest

* Determines how ______________ an effect is

\setstretch{1}

#### Sampling distribution {-}

\setstretch{1.5}

* Ideally, we would take many samples of the same ___________ from the same population to create a sampling distribution

* But only have 1 sample, so we will _________________ with _________________ from the one sample.

* Need to estimate the sampling distribution to see the _________________ in the sample

\setstretch{1}

#### Simulation-based methods {-}

Bootstrap distribution:

* Write the response variable values on cards

* Sample with replacement $n$ times (bootstrapping)

* Calculate and plot the simulated difference in sample means from each simulation

* Repeat 1000 times (simulations) to create the bootstrap distribution

* Find the cut-offs for the middle X% (confidence level) in a bootstrap distribution.

What is bootstrapping?

* Assume the “population” is many, many copies of the original sample.  

* Randomly sample with replacement from the original sample $n$ times. 

#### Video 14.2 {-}

Let's revisit the blue-eyed male study to estimate the *proportion of ALL heterosexual blue-eyed males who tend to find blue-eyed women the most attractive* by creating a 90\% confidence interval. 

Bootstrap distribution:
   
```{r, echo=TRUE}
set.seed(216)
one_proportion_bootstrap_CI(sample_size = 114, # Sample size
                    number_successes = 51, # Observed number of successes
                    number_repetitions = 1000, # Number of bootstrap samples to use
                    confidence_level = 0.90) # Confidence level as a decimal
```

Confidence interval interpretation:

* How confident you are (e.g., 90%, 95%, 98%, 99%)
    
* Parameter of interest
    
* Calculated interval
    
* Order of subtraction when comparing two groups

\vspace{0.8in}


\newpage

How does changing the confidence level impact the width of the confidence interval?


95\% Confidence Interval:

```{r, echo=TRUE, out.width="70%"}
set.seed(216)
one_proportion_bootstrap_CI(sample_size = 114, # Sample size
                    number_successes = 51, # Observed number of successes
                    number_repetitions = 1000, # Number of bootstrap samples to use
                    confidence_level = 0.95) # Confidence level as a decimal
```

99\% Confidence Interval:

```{r, echo=TRUE, out.width="70%"}
set.seed(216)
one_proportion_bootstrap_CI(sample_size = 114, # Sample size
                    number_successes = 51, # Observed number of successes
                    number_repetitions = 1000, # Number of bootstrap samples to use
                    confidence_level = 0.99) # Confidence level as a decimal
```
