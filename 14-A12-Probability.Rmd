\setstretch{1}

### Learning outcomes

* Recognize and simulate probabilities as long-run frequencies.

* Construct two-way tables to evaluate conditional probabilities.

### Terminology review

In today's activity, we will cover two-way tables and probability.  Some terms covered in this activity are:

* Proportions 

* Probability

* Conditional probability

* Two-way tables

To review these concepts, see Chapter 23 in the textbook.  


### Probability 

1. In a large general education class, 60\% of students are science majors and 40\% are liberal arts majors.  Twenty percent of the science majors are seniors, while 30\% of the liberal arts majors are seniors. Given the following two-way table answer the following questions.
\vspace{1mm}

    Let $A$ = the event the student is a senior, and $B$ = the event the student is a science major.
\vspace{0.1in}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline
\hspace{0.8in} & \hspace{0.25in} Senior $(A)$ \hspace{.25in} & \hspace{0.25in} Not a Senior ($A^c$) \hspace{0.25in} & \hspace{0.25in} Total \hspace{0.25in} \\ \hline
Science Major ($B$) & 12000 & 48000 & 60000 \\ \hline
Not a Science Major ($B^c$) & 12000 & 28000 & 40000 \\ \hline
Total & 24000 & 76000 & 100000 \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\vspace{.1in}

a. What is the probability that a randomly selected senior is a science major?  Use appropriate probability notation.

\vspace{0.5in}

b. What is the probability that a randomly selected student is both a senior and a science major.  Use appropriate probability notation.

\vspace{0.5in}

c. What is the probability that a randomly selected student is not a senior given they are a liberal arts major.  Use appropriate probability notation.

2. Since the early 1980s, the rapid antigen detection test (RADT) of group A *streptococci* has been used to detect strep throat. A recent study of the accuracy of this test shows that the **sensitivity**, the probability of a positive RADT given the person has strep throat, is 86% in children, while the **specificity**, the probability of a negative RADT given the person does not have strep throat, is 92% in children.  The **prevalence**, the probability of having group A strep, is 37% in children. [@stewart2014]
\vspace{1mm}

    Let $A$ = the event the child has strep throat, and $B$ = the event the child has a positive RADT.
\vspace{0.1in}

    a. Identify what each numerical value given in the problem represents in probability notation.
\vspace{.1in}

        0.86 =  
\vspace{.1in}
 
        0.92 =  
\vspace{.1in}

        0.37 =  
\vspace{.1in}

    b. Create a hypothetical two-way table to represent the situation.  
    
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline
\hspace{0.8in} & \hspace{0.35in} $A$ \hspace{.35in} & \hspace{0.35in} $A^c$  \hspace{0.35in} & \hspace{0.3in} Total \hspace{0.3in} \\ 
& & & \\ \hline
$B$& & & \\ 
& & & \\ \hline
$B^c$& & & \\ 
& & & \\ \hline
Total & & & 100,000 \\ 
& & & \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\vspace{.1in}

   c. Find $P(A \mbox{ and } B)$. What does this probability represent in the context of the problem?
\vspace{.8in}

   d. Find the probability that a child with a positive RADT actually has strep throat. What is the notation used for this probability?
\vspace{.8in}

   e.  What is the probability that a child does not have strep given that they have a positive RADT?  What is the notation used for this probability?

3. In a computer store, 30% of the computers in stock are laptops and 70% are desktops.  Five percent of the laptops are on sale, while 10% of the desktops are on sale.
\vspace{1mm}

    Let $L$ = the event the computer is a laptop, and $S$ = the event the computer is on sale.
\vspace{0.1in}

    a. Identify what each numerical value given in the problem represents in probability notation.
\vspace{.1in}

        0.30 =

        0.70 =  
\vspace{.1in}

        0.05 =  
\vspace{.1in}

        0.10 =  
\vspace{.1in}

    b. Create a hypothetical two-way table to represent the situation.  
    
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline
\hspace{0.8in} & \hspace{0.35in} $L$ \hspace{0.35in} & \hspace{0.35in} $L^c$ \hspace{0.35in} & \hspace{0.3in} Total \hspace{0.3in} \\

$S$ & & & \\ 
& & & \\ \hline
$S^c$ & & & \\

Total & & & 100,000 \\ 
& & & \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

   c. Calculate the probability that a randomly selected computer will be a desktop, given that the computer is on sale. What is the notation used for this probability?
\vspace{.8in}


   d. Find $P(S^C | L^C)$. What does this probability represent in context of the problem?
\vspace{1in}

   e. What is the probability a randomly selected computer is both a laptop and on sale?  Give the appropriate probability notation.

### Take home messages

1.  Conditional probabilities are calculated dependent on a second variable.  In probability notation, the variable following `|` is the variable on which we are conditioning.  The denominator used to calculate the probability will be the total for the variable on which we are conditioning.  


2. When creating a two-way table we typically want to put the explanatory variable on the columns of the table and the response variable on the rows.


3. To fill in the two-way table, always start with the unconditional variable in the total row or column and then use the conditional probabilities to fill in the interior cells.
