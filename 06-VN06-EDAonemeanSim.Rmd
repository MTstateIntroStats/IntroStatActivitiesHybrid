```{r, echo=TRUE, out.width="75%"}
moving %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Age))+ #Enter variable to plot
  geom_dotplot() + 
  labs(title = "Dotplot of Age of Buyers from Gallatin 
       County Home Sales", #Title your plot
       x = "Age", #x-axis label
       y = "Proportion") #y-axis label
```

Histogram:

       County Home Sales",
       #Title your plot
       x = "Age",
       y = "Count")

Let's look at side-by-side boxplot of the variable age by state of origin moved from.

```{r, echo=TRUE, out.width="85%"}
moving %>%  # Data set piped into...
  ggplot(aes(y = Age, x = From))+  # Identify variables
  geom_boxplot()+  # Tell it to make a box plot
  labs(title = "Side by side box plot of Age by State of Origin 
  of Buyers from Gallatin County Home Sales",  # Title
       x = "State of Origin",    # x-axis label
       y = "Age")  # y-axis label

       County Home Sales", 
       x = "Age",
       y = "Count")

### Video notes single quantitative variable inference

\setstretch{1}

Example:  What is the average weight of adult male polar bears?  The weight was measured on a representative sample of 83 male polar bears from the Southern Beaufort Sea.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
pb <- read.csv("https://math.montana.edu/courses/s216/data/polarbear.csv")
```

Plots of the data:

```{r, echo=TRUE, out.width="60%"}
pb %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = Weight)) +   # Name variable to plot
    geom_histogram(binwidth = 10) +  # Create histogram with specified binwidth
    labs(title = "Histogram of Male Polar Bear Weight", # Title for plot
       x = "Weight (kg)", # Label for x axis
       y = "Frequency") # Label for y axis

pb %>% # Data set piped into...
ggplot(aes(x = Weight)) +   # Name variable to plot
  geom_boxplot() +  # Create boxplot
  labs(title = "Boxplot of Male Polar Bear Weight", # Title for plot
       x = "Weight (kg)", # Label for x axis
       y = "Frequency") # Label for y axis
```

\newpage

Summary Statistics:

```{r, echo=TRUE}
pb %>%
  summarise(favstats(Weight)) #Gives the summary statistics
```

### Hypothesis testing {-}

\setstretch{1.5}

* Hypotheses are always written about the _________________________.  For a single mean we will use the notation ___________.

\setstretch{1}

Null Hypothesis:

$H_0:$

\vspace{0.2in}
Alternative Hypothesis:

$H_A:$

\vspace{0.2in}

\setstretch{1.5}

* Direction of the alternative depends on the __________________
___________________.

\setstretch{1}

#### Simulation-based method {-}

* Simulate many samples assuming $H_0: \mu = \mu_0$

    * Shift the data by the difference between $\mu_0$ and $\bar{x}$

    * Sample with replacement $n$ times from the shifted data

    * Plot the simulated shifted sample mean from each simulation

    * Repeat 1000 times (simulations) to create the null distribution

    * Find the proportion of simulations at least as extreme as $\bar{x}$

Example:  Is there evidence that male polar bears weigh less than 370kg (previously recorded measure), on average?  The weight was measured on a representative sample of 83 male polar bears from the Southern Beaufort Sea.

Hypotheses:

In notation:

$H_0:$

\vspace{0.2in}

$H_A:$

\vspace{0.2in}

\newpage

In words:

$H_0:$

\vspace{0.6in}

$H_A:$

\vspace{0.6in}

Reminder of summary statistics:

```{r, echo=TRUE}
pb %>%
  summarise(favstats(Weight)) #Gives the summary statistics
```
Find the difference:

$\mu_0 - \bar{x} =$

```{r, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, out.width="60%"}
set.seed(216)
one_mean_test(pb$Weight,   #Enter the object name and variable
              null_value = 370, #Enter null value for the study
              summary_measure = "mean",  #Can choose between mean or median
              shift = 45.4,   # Shift needed for bootstrap hypothesis test
              as_extreme_as = 324.6,  # Observed statistic
              direction = "less",  # Direction of alternative
              number_repetitions = 10000)  # Number of simulated samples for null distribution
```

\newpage

Interpretation of the p-value:

* Statement about probability or proportion of samples

* Statistic (summary measure and value)

* Direction of the alternative

* Null hypothesis (in context)


\vspace{0.8in}

Conclusion:

* Amount of evidence

* Parameter of interest

* Direction of the alternative hypothesis

#### Theory-based method {-}

Conditions for inference using theory-based methods:

- Independence:

\vspace{0.2in}

- Large enough sample size:

\vspace{0.2in}

### $t$-distribution {-}

In the theoretical approach, we use the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) to tell us that---under certain conditions---the distribution of sample means will be approximately normal, centered at the assumed true mean under $H_0$, and with standard deviation $\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$.

$$\bar{x} \sim N\left(\mu_0, \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}\right)$$
\setstretch{1.5}

* Estimate the population standard deviation, $\sigma$, with the
___________________________ standard deviation, ________.

* For a single quantitative variable we use the ____ - distribution
with _______________
degrees of freedom to approximate the sampling distribution.

\setstretch{1}

The $t^*$ multiplier is the value at the given percentile of the $t$-distribution with $n - 1$ degrees of freedom.

```{r, tstarpb, echo = F}

x <- seq(-4, 4, length=100)
hx<-dt(x, 82)
degf <- 82

plot(x, hx, type="l", lty=1, lwd=3, xlab="",
  ylab="Density", main="t-distribution with 82 df")

```

* Calculate the standardized statistic

* Find the area under the $t$-distribution with $n - 1$ df at least as extreme as the standardized statistic

Equation for the standard error of the sample mean:

\vspace{0.5in}

Equation for the standardized sample mean:

\vspace{0.5in}

Calculate the standardized sample mean weight of adult male polar bears:

\vspace{0.4in}

```{r, pvaluepb, echo = F}

x <- seq(-4, 4, length=100)
hx<-dt(x, 82)
degf <- 82

plot(x, hx, type="l", lty=1, lwd=3, xlab="",
  ylab="Density", main="t-distribution with 82 df")

```

Interpret the standardized sample mean weight:

\vspace{0.8in}

To find the theory-based p-value:

```{r, echo=TRUE}
pt(-4.683, df=82, lower.tail=TRUE)
```
