## Video Notes: Intro to data and Sampling Methods

\setstretch{1}

Read through Sections 1.1 -- 1.3 and 2.1 in the course textbook and watch the course videos prior to coming to class.  Fill in the following questions to aid in your understanding of the material.   

### Course Videos

* 1.2.1and1.2.2

* 2.1

### Data basics: Video 1.2.1and1.2.2 {-}

Data:  _______________________________ used to answer research questions

Observational unit or case:  the people or things we _____________________ data from; represents the ___________ in each data set

Variable: characteristics measured on each _______________________________.

#### Types of variables {-}

* Categorical variable: 

\vspace{0.5in}

\setstretch{1.5}
    
* Quantitative variable: 

\vspace{0.5in}

\setstretch{1.5}

Example:  The Bureau of Transportation Statistics [@bts] collects data on all forms of public transportation. The data set seen here includes several variables collect on flights departing on a random sample of 150 US airports in December of 2019.

\vspace{1mm}

```{r, echo=TRUE}
airport <- read.csv("data/airport_delay.csv")
glimpse(airport)
```

* What are the observational units?

\vspace{0.2in}

* Identify which variables are categorical.

\vspace{0.2in}

* Identify which variables are quantitative.

\vspace{0.2in}


#### Exploratory data analysis (EDA) {-}

Summary statistic: a single number which _______________________ an entire data set

* Also called the point estimate.

\rgi Examples: 

\rgi \rgi proportion of people who had a stroke

\vspace{0.3in}
    
\rgi \rgi mean (or average) age
    
\vspace{0.3in}

* The summary statistic and type of plot used depends on the type (categorical or quantitative) of variable(s)!  


\setstretch{1}


### Sampling Methods: Video 2.1 {-}

\setstretch{1.5}

The method used to collect data will impact 

* Target population: all _______________ or ______________ of interest 

* Sample:________________ or ________________ from which data is collected

\setstretch{1}

Example: Many high schools moved to partial or fully online schooling in Spring of 2020. Did students who graduated in 2020 tend to have a lower GPA during freshman year of college than the previous class of college freshmen? A nationally representative sample of 1000 college students who were freshmen in AY19-20 and 1000 college students who were freshmen in AY20-21 was taken to answer this question.

* What is the target population?

\vspace{0.2in}

* What is the sample?

\vspace{0.2in}

#### Good vs. bad sampling {-}

\setstretch{1.5}

GOAL: to have a sample that is _______________ of the
______________ _______________ on the variable(s) of interest

\setstretch{1}

* Unbiased sample methods:

\vspace{0.5in}

\rgi \rgi Simple random sample

* Biased sampling method: 

\vspace{0.5in}

### Types of Sampling Bias {-}

* Selection bias: 

\vspace{0.5in}

Example of Selection Bias: Newspaper article from 1936 reported that Landon won the presidential election over Roosevelt based on a poll of 10 million voters. Roosevelt was the actual winner.  What was wrong with this poll?  Poll was completed using a telephone survey and not all people in 1936 had a telephone.  Only a certain subset of the population owned a telephone so this subset was over-represented in the telephone survey. The results of the study, showing that Landon would win, did not represent the target population of all US voters.

* Non-response bias:  

\vspace{0.5in}

* To calculate the non-response rate: 
    
$$\frac{\text{number of people who do not respond}}{\text{total number of people selected for the sample}}\times 100\%$$
 
* For non-response bias to occur must first select people to participate and then they choose not to.
    

Example of Non-response bias:  A company randomly selects buyers to complete a review of an online purchase but some choose not to respond. 
    
* Response bias:

\vspace{0.5in}

Example of Response Bias: Police officer pulls you over and asks if you have been drinking.  Expect people to say no, whether they have been drinking or not.  
    
* Need to be able to predict how people will respond.
    
Words of caution:

* Convenience samples: gathering data for those who are easily
accessible; online polls

\setstretch{1.5}

\rgi \rgi Selection bias? 
    
\rgi \rgi Non-response bias?  
    
\rgi \rgi Response bias? 

* Random sampling reduces _________________ bias, but 
has no impact on ________________ or ______________ bias.

#### Optional Notes: Video Example {-}

A radio talk show asks people to phone in their views on whether the United States should pay off its debt to the United Nations.

* Selection?

\vspace{0.25in}

* Non-response?

\vspace{0.25in}

* Response?

The Wall Street Journal plans to make a prediction for the US presidential election based on a survey of its readers and plans to follow-up to ensure everyone responds.

* Selection?

\vspace{0.25in}

* Non-response?

\vspace{0.25in}

* Response?

\vspace{0.25in}
    
A police detective interested in determining the extent of drug use by high school students, randomly selects a sample of high school students and interviews each one about any illegal drug use by the student during the past year.

* Selection?

* Non-response?

* Response?
