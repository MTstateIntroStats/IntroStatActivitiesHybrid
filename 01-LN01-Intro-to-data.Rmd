## Lecture Notes Week 1: Intro to data

\setstretch{1}

Read through Sections 1.2.1 - 1.2.5 in the course textbook prior to coming to class on Friday using the reading guides at the beginning of week 1 material.

### Data basics: Sections 1.2.1 - 1.2.2 {-}

Data:  _______________________________ used to answer research questions

Observational unit or case:  the people or things we _____________________ data from

Variable: what is measured on each _________________ or
__________________.

#### Types of variables {-}

* Categorical Variable: 

\vspace{0.5in}

\rgi Ordinal:  levels of the variable have a _________________________ ordering 
    
\rgi \rgi Examples: ‘Scale’ questions, Years of schooling completed

\rgi Nominal:levels of the variable do _______________ have a natural ordering

\rgi \rgi Examples: hair color, eye color, zipcode
    
* Quantitative Variable: 

\vspace{0.5in}

\rgi Continuous variables: value can be any ____________________ within a range.
    
\rgi \rgi Examples: percentage of students who are nursing majors, average hours of exercise per week; distance or time (measured with enough precision)

\rgi Discrete variables: can only be ___________________________ values, with jumps between
    
\rgi \rgi Examples: years of schooling completed; SAT score, number of car accidents
    
Example:  The Bureau of Transportation Statistics collects data on all forms of public transportation. The data set seen here includes several variables collect on flights departing on a random sample of 150 US airports in December of 2019.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
airport <- read.csv("data/airport_delay.csv")
glimpse(airport)
```

* What are the observational units?

\vspace{0.2in}

* Identify which variables are categorical.

\vspace{0.2in}

* Identify which variables are quantitative.

#### Exploratory data analysis (EDA) {-}

Summary statistic: a number which _______________________ an entire data set

* Also called the ___________ ____________

\rgi Examples: 

\rgi \rgi proportion of people who had a stroke

\vspace{0.3in}
    
\rgi \rgi mean (or average) age
    
\vspace{0.3in}

* Summary statistic and type of plot used depends on the type of variable(s)!  

### Roles of variables: Sections 1.2.3 - 1.2.5 {-}

Explanatory variable: predictor variable

* The variable researchers think *may be* _____________ 
the other variable.
    
* In an experiment, what the researchers _____________ or ________________.
    
* The groups that we are comparing from the data set.

Response variable: 

* The variable researchers think *may be* ___________________ by the other variable.

* Always simply ________________ or __________________; never controlled by researchers.

Examples:

Can you predict a criminal’s height based on the footprint left at the scene of a crime?

* Identify the explanatory variable:

\vspace{0.3in}

* Identify the response variable:

\vspace{0.3in}

Does marking an item on sale (even without changing the price) increase the number of units sold per day, on average?

* Identify the explanatory variable:

\vspace{0.3in}

* Identify the response variable:

In the Physician's Health Study, male physicians participated in a study to determine whether taking a daily low-dose aspirin reduced the risk of heart attacks. The male physicians were randomly assigned to the treatment groups. After five years, 104 of the 11,037 male physicians taking a daily low-dose aspirin had experienced a heart attack while 189 of the 11,034 male physicians taking a placebo had experienced a heart attack. 

* Identify the explanatory variable:

\vspace{0.3in}

* Identify the response variable:

\vspace{0.3in}

#### Relationships between variables {-}

\setstretch{1.5}

* Association: the _____________ between variables create a pattern; knowing something about one variable tells us about the other.

    * Positive association: as one variable _____________, the other tends to _______________ also.
    
    * Negative association: as one variable _____________, the other tends to _____________.

* Independent: no clear pattern can be seen between the __________.
