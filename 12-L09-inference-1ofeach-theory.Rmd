### Learning outcomes

* Given a research question involving one categorical explanatory variable and one quantitative response variable, construct the null and alternative hypotheses
  in words and using appropriate statistical symbols.

* Describe and perform a theory-based hypothesis test for a difference in means.

* Interpret and evaluate a p-value for a theory-based hypothesis test for a difference in means.

* Use theory-based methods to find a confidence interval for a difference in means.

* Interpret a confidence interval for a difference in means.

* Use a confidence interval to determine the conclusion of a hypothesis test.

### Terminology review

In today's activity, we will use theory-based methods to analyze the association between one categorical explanatory variable and one quantitative response variable, where the groups formed by the categorical variable are independent. Some terms covered in this activity are:

* Difference in means

* Independence within and between groups

* Normality

To review these concepts, see Chapter 19 in the textbook.


### The triple crown 

The Triple Crown of "Thru" hiking consists of hiking the Appalachian Trail, the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT), and the Continental Divide Trail (CDT). Each year halfwayanywhere.com conducts a survey to better understand the people who hike these trails. One variable which is queried in the survey is the pre-hike "base weight" of a hiker's pack which is the total weight of gear without food, water, and worn gear. The 131 hikers surveyed who completed the CDT had a mean base weight of 15.266 lbs (sd = 5.128 lbs).  The 484 hikers surveyed who completed the PCT had a mean base weight of 17.837 lbs (sd = 7.823 lbs). Is there a difference in average base weight for PCT hikers and CDT hikers?  Use order of subtraction CDT - PCT.

The sampling distribution for $\bar{x}_1-\bar{x}_2$ can be modeled using a normal distribution when certain conditions are met.

Conditions for the sampling distribution of $\bar{x}_1-\bar{x}_2$ to follow an approximate normal distribution:

* **Independence**: The sampleâ€™s observations are independent

* **Normality**: Each sample should be approximately normal or have a large sample size. For *each* sample:

    - $n < 30$: If the sample size $n$ is less than 30 and there are no clear outliers in the data, then we typically assume the data come from a nearly normal distribution to satisfy the condition.

    - $n \ge 30$: If the sample size $n$ is at least 30 and there are no particularly extreme outliers, then we typically assume the sampling distribution of $\bar{x}$ is nearly normal, even if the underlying distribution of individual observations is not.
    
     - $n \geq 100$: If the sample size $n$ is at least 100 (regardless of the presence of skew or outliers), we typically assume the sampling distribution of $\bar{x}$ is nearly normal, even if the underlying distribution of individual observations is not.
    
Upload and open the R script file for Week 12 lab. Upload and import the csv file, `Trail_Weight`. Enter the name of the data set (see the environment tab) for datasetname in the R script file in line 7. Write a title for the boxplots in line 11. Highlight and run lines 1--13 to load the data and create plots of the data.

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
hikes <- datasetname
hikes %>%  # Data set piped into...
  ggplot(aes(y = Baseweight, x = Trail))+  # Identify variables
  geom_boxplot()+  # Tell it to make a box plot
  labs(title = "xx",  # Title
       x = "Trail",    # x-axis label
       y = "Baseweight(lbs)")  # y-axis label
```

4.  Is the independence condition met?  Explain your answer.

5. Check that the normality condition is met to use theory-based methods to analyze these data.

Enter the name of the explanatory variable for `explanatory` and the name of the response variable for `response` in line 17.  Highlight and run lines 16--17 to get the summary statistics for the data.

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
hikes %>%
  summarize(favstats(response~explanatory))
```

6. **Calculate the summary statistic (difference in means) for this study.  Use appropriate notation with clearly defined subscripts.**

#### Use statistical inferential methods to draw inferences from the data {-}

To find the standardized statistic for the difference in means we will calculate:

$$T = \frac{\bar{x}_1-\bar{x}_2}{SE(\bar{x}_1-\bar{x}_2)},$$

where the standard error of the difference in means is calculated using:

$$SE(\bar{x}_1 -\bar{x}_2)=\sqrt{\frac{s_1^2}{n_1}+\frac{s_2^2}{n_2}}.$$

9.  When we are comparing two quantitative variables to find the degrees of freedom to use for the t-distribution, we need to use the group with the smallest sample size and subtract 1.  (`df` = minimum of $n_1 - 1$ or  $n_2 - 1$).  Calculate the `df` for this study.

10. Using the provided R script file, enter the T-score (for `xx`) and the `df` calculated in question 9 for `yy` into the `pt()` function to find the p-value.  Highlight and run line 20.  Report the p-value calculated. 

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
2*pt(xx, df=yy, lower.tail=FALSE)
```

12.  Do you expect the 95\% confidence interval to contain the null value of zero?  Explain your answer.
\vspace{0.8in}


To calculate a theory-based 95\% confidence interval for a difference in means, use the formula:

$$\bar{x}_1- \bar{x}_2\pm t^* SE(\bar{x}_1- \bar{x}_2).$$

We will need to find the $t^*$ multiplier using the function `qt()`.  For a 95\% confidence level, we are finding the $t^*$ value at the 97.5th percentile with (`df` = minimum of $n_1 - 1$ or  $n_2 - 1$).

Enter the appropriate percentile value (as a decimal) for `xx` and degrees of freedom for `yy` into the `qt()` function at line 23 to find the appropriate $t^*$ multiplier

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
qt(xx, df = yy, lower.tail=FALSE)
```
13. Report the $t^*$ multiplier for the 95\% confidence interval.
