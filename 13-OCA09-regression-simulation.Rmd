### Diving Penguins

Emperor penguins are the most accomplished divers among birds, making routine dives of 5–12 minutes, with the longest recorded dive over 27 minutes. These birds can also dive to depths of over 500 meters! Since air-breathing animals like penguins must hold their breath while submerged, the duration of any given dive depends on how much oxygen is in the bird’s body at the beginning of the dive, how quickly that oxygen gets used, and the lowest level of oxygen the bird can tolerate. The rate of oxygen depletion is primarily determined by the penguin’s heart rate. Consequently, studies of heart rates during dives can help us understand how these animals regulate their oxygen consumption in order to make such impressive dives. The researchers equipped emperor penguins with devices that record their heart rates during dives. The data set reports Dive Heart Rate (beats per minute), the Duration (minutes) of dives, and other related variables.  Can the dive heart rate be used to predict the duration of the dive for Emperor Penguins?

```{r, echo = TRUE, fig.width=7,fig.height=6, collapse=FALSE}
# Read in data set
diving <- read.csv("https://math.montana.edu/courses/s216/data/Diving_Penguins.csv")
```

#### Vocabulary review {-}

1. Explain why regression methods are appropriate to use to address the researchers' question. Make sure you clearly define the variables of interest in your explanation and their roles.

\vspace{.5in}


Use the provided R script file to create a scatterplot to examine the relationship between the diving heart rate and duration of the dive by filling in the variable names (`Dive_HeartRate` and `Duration`) for `explanatory` and `response` in line 9.  Highlight and run lines 1--15. 
 
```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
diving %>% # Pipe data set into...
ggplot(aes(x = explanatory, y = response))+  # Specify variables
  geom_point() +  # Add scatterplot of points
  labs(x = "Heart Rate (bpm)",  # Label x-axis
       y = "Dive Duration (min)",  # Label y-axis
       title = "Scatterplot of Emperor Penguins Diving Heart Rate vs. Dive Duration") + 
               # Be sure to title your plots
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)  # Add regression line

```

2. Sketch the plot created below. Based on your plot, does it appear that there is a relationship between dive heart rate and duration of the dive? Note: `Dive_HeartRate` should be on the $x$-axis.

\vspace{2in}

3. Describe the features of the plot above, addressing all four characteristics of a scatterplot.  

\vspace{1in}

\vspace{0.5in}

#### Ask a research question {-}

4. Write out the null hypothesis in words to test slope.

\vspace{1in}

5. Using the research question, write the alternative hypothesis in notation using slope as the summary measure.

\vspace{0.5in}

#### Summarize and visualize the data {-}

Using the provided R script file, enter the response variable name, `Duration`, into the `lm()` (linear model) function for `response` and the explanatory variable name, `Dive_HeartRate`, for `explanatory` in line 18 to get the linear model output and value for the correlation coefficient.  Highlight and run lines 18--20.

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval =FALSE}
lm.diving <- lm(response~explanatory, data=diving) # lm(response~explanatory)
round(summary(lm.diving)$coefficients, 5)
cor(diving$Duration, diving$Dive_HeartRate)
```

6.  Using the output from the evaluated R code above, write the equation of the regression line in the context of the problem using appropriate statistical notation.
\vspace{1in}

7.  Interpret the estimated slope in context of the problem.

\vspace{1in}

8.  Report the value of correlation between the diving heart rate and the duration of the dive. 

\vspace{0.3in}

#### Use statistical inferential methods to draw inferences from the data {-}

In this activity, we will focus on using simulation-based methods for inference in regression.  

#### Simulation-based hypothesis test {-}

Let's start by thinking about how one simulation would be created on the null distribution using cards.  First, we would write the values for the response variable, Duration, on each card.  Next, we would shuffle these $y$ values while keeping the $x$ values (explanatory variable) in the same order.  Then, find the line of regression for the shuffled $(x, y)$ pairs and calculate either the slope or correlation of the shuffled sample.  

We will use the `regression_test()` function in R (in the `catstats` package) to simulate the null distribution of shuffled slopes (or shuffled correlations) and compute a p-value.  We will need to enter the response variable name and the explanatory variable name for the formula, the data set name (identified above as `diving`), the summary measure for the test (either slope or correlation), number of repetitions, the sample statistic (value of slope or correlation), and the direction of the alternative hypothesis.

The response variable name is `Duration` and the explanatory variable name is `Dive_HeartRate` for these data.

9. What inputs should be entered for each of the following to create the simulation to test regression slope?

\vspace{.5 mm}

* Direction (`"greater"`, `"less"`, or `"two-sided"`):

\vspace{.2in}

* Summary measure (choose `"slope"` or `"correlation"`):

\vspace{.2in}
* As extreme as (enter the value for the sample slope):

\vspace{0.2in}

* Number of repetitions:
    
\vspace{.2in}

Using the R script file for this activity, enter your answers for question 9 in place of the `xx`'s to produce the null distribution with 1000 simulations.  Highlight and run lines 23--28.

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
regression_test(Duration ~ Dive_Heartrate, # response ~ explanatory
               data = diving, # Name of data set
               direction = "xx", # Sign in alternative ("greater", "less", "two-sided")
               summary_measure = "xx", # "slope" or "correlation"
               as_extreme_as = x, # Observed slope or correlation
               number_repetitions = 1000) # Number of simulated samples for null distribution
```

10.  Report the p-value from the R output. 
\vspace{0.5in}

11.  Suppose we wanted to complete the simulation test using correlation as the summary measure, instead of slope.  Which two inputs in #9 would need to be changed to test for correlation?  What inputs should you use instead?
\vspace{0.75in}

12.  Change the inputs in lines 23--28 to test for correlation instead of slope.  Highlight and run those lines, then report the new p-value of the test.
\vspace{0.5in}

13.  The p-values from the test of slope (#10) and the test of correlation (#12) should be similar.  Explain why the two p-values should match. *Hint: think about the relationship between slope and correlation!*
\vspace{1in}

#### Simulation-based confidence interval {-}

We will use the `regression_bootstrap_CI()` function in R (in the `catstats` package) to simulate the bootstrap distribution of sample slopes (or sample correlations) and calculate a confidence interval. Fill in the `xx`'s in the the provided R script file to find a 95\% confidence interval for slope. Highlight and run lines 31--35. 

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
regression_bootstrap_CI(Duration ~ Dive_Heartrate, # response ~ explanatory
   data = diving, # Name of data set
   confidence_level = xx, # Confidence level as decimal
   summary_measure = "xx", # Slope or correlation
   number_repetitions = 1000) # Number of simulated samples for bootstrap distribution
```
14.  Report the bootstrap 95\% confidence interval in interval notation.  
\vspace{0.5in}

15.  Interpret the interval in question 14 in context of the problem.  *Hint: use the interpretation of slope in your confidence interval interpretation.*

\vspace{0.8in}
   
#### Communicate the results and answer the research question {-}

16. Based on the p-value, write a conclusion in context of the problem.

\vspace{.8in}

17. Does the conclusion based on the p-value agree with the results of the 95\% confidence interval?  What does each tell you about the null hypothesis?

\vspace{.6in}

### Take-home messages

1.	The p-value for a test for correlation should be approximately the same as the p-value for the test of slope.  In the simulation test, we just change the statistic type from slope to correlation and use the appropriate sample statistic value.  

2. To interpret a confidence interval for the slope, think about how to interpret the sample slope and use that information in the confidence interval interpretation for slope.  

3. To create one simulated sample on the null distribution when testing for a relationship between two quantitative variables, hold the $x$ values constant and shuffle the $y$ values to new $x$ values. Find the regression line for the shuffled data and plot the slope or the correlation for the shuffled data.

4. To create one simulated sample on the bootstrap distribution when assessing two quantitative variables, label $n$ cards with the original (response, explanatory) values.  Randomly draw with replacement $n$ times.  Find the regression line for the resampled data and plot the resampled slope or correlation.
