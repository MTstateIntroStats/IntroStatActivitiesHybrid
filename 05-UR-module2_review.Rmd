## Module 2 Review

1.  Spelling errors in a text can either be non-word errors (teh instead of the) or word errors (lose instead of loose). It was found that non-word errors make up about 25% of all errors. A human proofreader will catch 92% of non-word errors and 75% of word errors.

Let N represent non-word errors and C represent that a human proofreader will catch the error.

a. Identify the following values with appropriate probability notation.
\vspace{2mm}

    $0.25$
\vspace{2mm}

    $0.92$
\vspace{2mm}

    $0.75$
\vspace{2mm}

b. Fill in the table below to represent the situation:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline
\hspace{0.8in} & \hspace{0.25in}  $N$ \hspace{.25in} & \hspace{0.25in} $N^C$ \hspace{0.25in} & \hspace{0.25in} Total \hspace{0.25in} \\ \hline
 $C$ &  &  &  \\ \hline
 $C^C$ &  & &  \\ \hline
Total &  &  & 100000 \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\vspace{.1in}

c. Using your table calculate the probability that a randomly selected error caught by a human proofreader is a non-word error. Use appropriate probability notation.

\vspace{1in}

d. Find the probability a selected error is a non-word error and was not caught by a human proofreader. Use appropriate probability notation.

\vspace{1in}

e. Find the value of $P(N|C)$. What does this probability mean?

2.	A private college report contains these statistics:

* 70\% of incoming freshmen attended public schools

* 75\% of public-school students who enroll as freshmen eventually graduate

* 90\% of other freshmen eventually graduate

Let A represent the event that a freshman attended public school and B the event that a freshman eventually graduates.

a. Identify the following values with appropriate probability notation.

\vspace{2mm}

     = 0.70
\vspace{2mm}     
    
    = 0.75
\vspace{2mm}

    = 0.90
\vspace{2mm}

b. Fill in the table below to represent the situation:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline
\hspace{0.8in} & \hspace{0.25in}  $A$ \hspace{.25in} & \hspace{0.25in} $A^C$ \hspace{0.25in} & \hspace{0.25in} Total \hspace{0.25in} \\ \hline
 $B$ &  &  &  \\ \hline
 $B^C$ &  & &  \\ \hline
Total &  &  & 100000 \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\vspace{.1in}


c. Calculate the probability a selected freshman attended public school given they did not graduate.  Use appropriate probability notation.

\vspace{1in}

d. Calculate the probability a selected freshman does not graduate.  Use appropriate probability notation.

\vspace{1in}

e. Of the population of freshman that attended public school, what is the probability they do not graduate. Use appropriate probability notation.

\vspace{1in}


f. Find the value of $P(A \text{and} B^C)$.  Write this probability in context of the problem.
