\setstretch{1}

### Learning outcomes

* Assess the conditions to use the normal distribution model for a difference in proportions.

* Create and interpret a theory-based confidence interval for a difference in proportions.

* Calculate and interpret the standardized difference in sample proportion 

* Use the standard normal distribution to find the p-value for the test

### Terminology review
In today's activity, we will use theory-based methods to estimate the difference in two proportions. Some terms covered in this activity are:

* Standard normal distribution

* Independence and success-failure conditions

To review these concepts, see Chapter 15 in your textbook.

### Winter sports helmet use and head injury 

In this activity we will focus on theory-based methods. The sampling distribution of a difference in proportions can be mathematically modeled using the normal distribution if certain conditions are met.

Conditions for the sampling distribution of $\hat{p}_1-\hat{p}_2$ to follow an approximate normal distribution:

* **Independence**: The data are independent within and between the two groups. (*Remember*: This also must be true to use simulation methods!)

* **Success-failure condition**: This condition is met if we have at least 10 successes and 10 failures in each sample. Equivalently, we check that all cells in the table have at least 10 observations.

A study was reported in "Helmet Use and Risk of Head Injuries in Alpine Skiers and Snowboarders" by Sullheim et. al., [@sulheim2017], on the use of helmets and head injuries for skiers and snowboarders involved in accidents.  The summary results from a random sample of 3562 skiers and snowboarders involved in accidents is shown in the two-way table below. 

|                | Helmet Use | No Helmet Use | Total |
|:--------------:|:----------:|:-------------:|:-----:|
| Head Injury    |     96     |      480      |  576  |
| No Head Injury |     656    |      2330     |  2986 |
| Total          |     752    |      2810     |  3562 |

Is there evidence that safety helmet use is associated with a reduced risk of head injury for skiers and snowboarders?

<!-- #### Confidence interval {-} -->

<!-- To find a confidence interval for the difference in proportions we will add and subtract the margin of error from the point estimate to find the two endpoints. -->

<!--  $$\hat{p}_1-\hat{p}_2\pm z^*\times SE(\hat{p}_1-\hat{p}_2), \hspace{.2cm} \text{where}$$ -->
<!--  $$SE(\hat{p}_1-\hat{p}_2) = \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}_1 \times  (1-\hat{p}_1)}{n_1}+\frac{\hat{p}_2 \times  (1-\hat{p}_2)}{n_2}}$$ -->

<!-- In this formula, we use the sample proportions for each group to calculate the standard error for the difference in proportions since we are not assuming that the true difference is zero. -->

<!-- <!-- To calculate the standard error for a difference in proportions to create a 90\% confidence interval we substitute in the two sample proportions and the sample size for each group into the equation above. --> 

<!-- 2. Calculate the standard error for a difference in proportions to find a 90\% confidence interval. -->

<!-- \vspace{0.5in} -->

<!-- <!-- $$n_1 = 752, n_2 = 2810, \hat{p}_h = \frac{96}{752} = 0.128, \hat{p}_n = \frac{480}{2810} = 0.171$$ --> 

<!-- <!--  $$SE(\hat{p}_1-\hat{p}_2) = \sqrt{\frac{0.128\times (1-0.128)}{752}+\frac{0.171\times (1-0.171)}{2810}} = 0.014$$ --> 

<!-- Recall that the $z^*$ multiplier is the percentile of a standard normal distribution that corresponds to our confidence level. If our confidence level is 90\%, we find the Z values that encompass the middle 90\% of the standard normal distribution. If 90\% of the standard normal distribution should be in the middle, that leaves 10\% in the tails, or 5\% in each tail.  The `qnorm()` function in R will tell us the $z^*$ value for the desired percentile (in this case, 90\% + 5\% = 95\% percentile).  -->

<!-- ```{r, echo=TRUE, collapse=FALSE} -->
<!-- qnorm(0.95, lower.tail = TRUE) # Multiplier for 90% confidence interval -->

<!-- $$ME = z^*\times SE(\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2)$$ -->

<!-- 3. Using the multiplier of $z^*$ = 1.645 and the calculated standard error, calculate the **margin of error** for a 90\% confidence interval. -->

#### Hypothesis test {-}

For this study, we will see if there is evidence that safety helmet use is associated with a
reduced risk of head injury for skiers and snowboarders.

2. Write the null and alternative hypotheses in notation. 

|    $H_0$: 
\vspace{0.2in}

|    $H_A$:
\vspace{0.2in}


#### Use statistical analysis methods to draw inferences from the data {-}

To test the null hypothesis, we could use simulation-based methods as we did in the activities in Module 8. In this activity, we will focus on theory-based methods.  Like with a single proportion, the sampling distribution of a difference in sample proportions can be mathematically modeled using the normal distribution if certain conditions are met.

To calculate the standardized statistic we use: 

$$
Z = \frac{(\hat{p_1} - \hat{p_2}) - \text{null value}}{SE_0(\hat{p_1}-\hat{p}_2)},
$$

where the null standard error is calculated using the pooled proportion of successes:

$$
SE_0(\hat{p}_1-\hat{p}_2)=\sqrt{\hat{p}_{pool}\times (1-\hat{p}_{pool})\times \left(\frac{1}{n_1}+\frac{1}{n_2}\right)}.
$$
For this study we would first calculate the pooled proportion of successes.

$$\hat{p}_{pool} = \frac{\text{number of "successes"}}{\text{number of cases}} $$
\vspace{1mm}

**Calculate the pooled proportion of head injuries.**

\vspace{0.8in}

**Use the value for the pooled proportion of successes to calculate the $SE_0(\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2)$ assuming the null hypothesis is true.**

\vspace{1in}

**Use the value of the null standard error to calculate the standardized statistic (standardized difference in proportion).**

\vspace{0.8in}

\newpage

```{r simpleNormal, warning=FALSE, out.width="50%"}
openintro::normTail(m = 0, s = 1)
```

3. Interpret the standardized statistic in context of the problem.
\vspace{0.6in}

We will use the `pnorm()` function in R to find the p-value. 

* Enter the value of z for xx

* Highlight and run lines 17--19

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE, collapse=FALSE}
pnorm(-2.855, # Enter value of standardized statistic
      m=0, s=1, # Using the standard normal mean = 0, sd = 1
      lower.tail=TRUE) # Gives a p-value less than the standardized statistic
```

**Interpretation of the p-value:**

\vspace{1in}

#### Confidence Interval {-}

To find a confidence interval for the difference in proportions we will add and subtract the margin of error from the point estimate to find the two endpoints.

 $$\hat{p}_1-\hat{p}_2\pm z^*\times SE(\hat{p}_1-\hat{p}_2), \hspace{.2cm} \text{where}$$
 $$SE(\hat{p}_1-\hat{p}_2) = \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}_1 \times  (1-\hat{p}_1)}{n_1}+\frac{\hat{p}_2 \times  (1-\hat{p}_2)}{n_2}}$$
 
In this formula, we use the sample proportions for each group to calculate the standard error for the difference in proportions since we are not assuming that the true difference is zero.

**Calculate the standard error of the sample proportion not assuming the null hypothesis is true.**

\vspace{0.8in}
\newpage

Recall that the $z^*$ multiplier is the percentile of a standard normal distribution that corresponds to our confidence level. If our confidence level is 90\%, we find the Z values that encompass the middle 90\% of the standard normal distribution. If 90\% of the standard normal distribution should be in the middle, that leaves 10\% in the tails, or 5\% in each tail.  The `qnorm()` function in R will tell us the $z^*$ value for the desired percentile (in this case, 90\% + 5\% = 95\% percentile). 

```{r, echo=TRUE, collapse=FALSE}
qnorm(0.95, lower.tail = TRUE) # Multiplier for 90% confidence interval
```

Remember that the margin of error is the value added and subtracted to the sample difference in proportions to find the endpoints for the confidence interval.

$$ME = z^*\times SE(\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2)$$

**Using the multiplier of $z^*$ = 1.645 and the calculated standard error, calculate the margin of error for a 90\% confidence interval.**

### Effect of sample size

How would an increase in sample size impact the width of the confidence interval.  Suppose in another sample of skiers and snowboards involved in accidents we saw these results:

|                | Helmet Use | No Helmet Use | Total |
|:--------------:|:----------:|:-------------:|:-----:|
| Head Injury    |     135    |      674      |  809  |
| No Head Injury |     921    |      3270     |  4191 |
| Total          |     1056   |      3944     |  5000 |

Note that the sample proportions for each group are the same as the smaller sample size.

$$\hat{p}_h = \frac{135}{1056}=0.128, \hspace{2mm} \hat{p}_n = \frac{674}{3944}=0.171$$

 $$SE(\hat{p}_1-\hat{p}_2) = \sqrt{\frac{0.128\times (1-0.128)}{1056}+\frac{0.171\times (1-0.171)}{3944}} = 0.012$$
 
Margin of Error for 90\% confidence interval:

$$ME = 1.645 \times 0.012 = 0.020$$

90\% Confidence Interval:

$$(0.128 - 0.171) \pm 0.02$$
$$(-0.063, -0.023)$$

<!-- First calculate the pooled proportion of successes. -->

<!-- $$\hat{p}_{pool} = \frac{\text{number of "successes"}}{\text{number of cases}} = \frac{809}{5000} = 0.162$$ -->

<!-- We use the value for the pooled proportion of successes to calculate the $SE_0(\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2)$. -->


<!-- $$ -->
<!-- SE_0(\hat{p}_1-\hat{p}_2)=\sqrt{0.162 \times (1-0.162)\times \left(\frac{1}{1056}+\frac{1}{3944}\right)} = 0.013 -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- Standardized Statistic Calculation: -->

<!-- $$Z = \frac{0.128 - 0.171 - 0}{0.013} = -3.308$$ -->

<!-- Use Rstudio to find the p-value for this new sample.   -->

<!-- ```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE, collapse=FALSE} -->
<!-- pnorm(-3.308, # Enter value of standardized statistic -->
<!--       m=0, s=1, # Using the standard normal mean = 0, sd = 1 -->
<!--       lower.tail=TRUE) # Gives a p-value greater than the standardized statistic -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- \vspace{0.8in} -->


<!-- 11. Calculate the margin of error for a 90\% confidence interval using a multiplier of $z^*$ = 1.645 for this new sample.  Is the margin of error larger or smaller than the margin of error for the original study? -->
<!-- \vspace{.8in} -->

<!-- 12.  Calculate the 90\% confidence interval for this new study using the margin of error from question 10.   -->
<!-- \vspace{.8in} -->

<!-- 13.  Is the confidence interval calculated in question 12 with the larger sample size wider or narrower than the confidence interval in question 6? Why? -->
\vspace{.8in}

### Take-home messages

1. Simulation-based methods and theory-based methods should give similar results for a study *if the validity conditions are met*.  For both methods, observational units need to be independent. To use theory-based methods, additionally, the success-failure condition must be met. Check the validity conditions for each type of test to determine if theory-based methods can be used.

2. When calculating the standard error for the difference in sample proportions when doing a hypothesis test, we use the pooled proportion of successes, the best estimate for calculating the variability *under the assumption the null hypothesis is true*.   

3.  Increasing sample size will result in less sample-to-sample variability in statistics, which will result in a smaller standard error, and a narrower confidence interval.
