# Basics of Data and Sampling Methods

## Vocabulary Review and Key Topics 

At the beginning of each module is a list of new vocabulary terms and key topics for that module.  As you read through the material in the text book and watch the videos prior to class, look for these terms.  Reference the following definitions to guide your understanding.

### Module 1 Vocabulary - Note synomyms are listed in paratheses

* **Data**: observations used to answer research questions

* **Observational units (cases)**: the subjects data is collected on

    * The rows in a data set represent the observational units

* **Variable**: the characteristics collected on each observational unit

* **Types of variables**:

    * Categorical: cases are grouped into categories


    * Quantitative: numerical measurements, where performing arithmetic operations makes sense

* **Target population**: group of observational units of interest

* **Sample**: subset of the population

* **Sampling methods**:

    * **Unbiased sampling method (i.e. a random sample)**: on average, the sample will be representative of the target population; all observational units in the target population have the same chance of being selected

    * **Biased sampling method (i.e. convenience sample)**: on average, the sample will not be representative of the target population; some part of the target population will be over or under represented

* **Type of sampling bias**:

    * **Selection bias**: method of sampling is biased; some part of the target population is over or under represented

    * **Non-response bias**: part of a pre-selected sample does not respond or cannot be reached

    * **Response bias**: responses are not truthful (poor/leading question phrasing, social desirability)

* **Generalization**: to what group of observational units can the results be applied to?  

    * If an unbiased method of selection was used, we can generalize the results to the target population.

    * If a biased method of selection was used, we can generalize the result to the sample or similar observational units.
