### Probability {-}

Example: Two variables were collected on a random sample of people who had ever been married; whether a person had ever smoked and whether a person had ever been divorced. The data are displayed in the following table. This survey was based on a random sample in the United States in the early 1990s, so the data should be representative of the adult population who had ever been married at that time. 

* Let event D be a person has gone through a divorce

* Let event S be a person smokes

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline
\hspace{0.8in} & \hspace{0.35in} Has divorced \hspace{.35in} & \hspace{0.35in} Has never divorced  \hspace{0.35in} & \hspace{0.3in} Total \hspace{0.3in} \\

Smokes & 238 & 247 & 485 \\

* Event: something that could occur, something we want to find the probability of

    * Getting a four when rolling a fair die

* Complement: opposite of the event

    * Getting any value but a four when rolling a fair die

* The probability of an event is the ______________ proportion of times the event would occur if the ________________ process were repeated indefinitely.

    * For example, the probability of getting a four when rolling a fair die is ___________.

* Unconditional probabilities

    * An ____________________probability is calculated from the entire population not_____________________________
    on the occurrence of another event.

    * Examples:

        * The probability of a single event

            * The probability a selected Stat 216 student is a computer science major.

        * An “And” probability

            * The probability a selected Stat 216 student is a computer science major and a freshman.

* Conditional probabilities

    * A _____________________ probability is calculated
_______________________ on the occurrence of another event.

    * Examples:

        * The probability of event A given B

            * The probability a selected freshman Stat 216 student is a computer science major.

        * The probability of event B given A

            * The probability a selected computer science Stat 216 student is a freshman

#### Creating a hypothetical two-way table {-}

Steps:

* Start with a large number like 100000.  

* Then use the unconditional probabilities to fill in the row or column totals. 

* Now use the conditional probabilities to begin filling in the interior cells.  

* Use subtraction to find the remaining interior cells.

* Add the column values together for each row to find the row totals.

* Add the row values together for each column to find the column totals.

Example:  An airline has noticed that 30\% of passengers pre-pay for checked bags at the time the ticket is purchased.  The no-show rate among customers that pre-pay for checked bags is 5\%, compared to 15\% among customers that do not pre-pay for checked bags.

* Let event B = customer pre-pays for checked bag
* Let event N = customer no shows

Start by identifying the probability notation for each value given.

### Concept Check

Be prepared for group discussion in the next class. One member from the table should write the answers to the following on the whiteboard.

1. Calculate and interpret the following: $P(D^C|S^C)=$.

2. What is the probability notation for 0.15 in the airline example?
