You may skip example 15.1.4, which discussed hypothesis testing for **relative risk**.  We will discuss relative risk in Week 14.

#### Reminders from previous sections {-}

$n$ = sample size

$\hat{p}$ = sample proportion

$\pi$ = population proportion

General steps of a hypothesis test:

1. Frame the research question in terms of hypotheses.

2. Collect and summarize data using a test statistic.
	
3. Assume the null hypothesis is true, and simulate or mathematically model a null distribution for the test statistic.

4. Compare the observed test (standardized) statistic to the null distribution to calculate a p-value.

5. Make a conclusion based on the p-value and write the conclusion in context.

Parameter: a value summarizing a variable(s) for a population.

Statistic: a value summarizing a variable(s) for a sample.

Sampling distribution: plot of statistics from 1000s of samples of the same size taken from the same population.

Standard deviation of a statistic: the variability of statistics from 1000s of samples; how far, on average, each statistic is from the true value of the parameter.

Standard error of a statistic: estimated standard deviation of a statistic.

Hypothesis test: a process to determine how strong the evidence of an effect is.
		
\rgi Also called a ‘significance test’.

Simulation-based method: Simulate lots of samples of size $n$ under assumption of the null hypothesis, then find the proportion of the simulations that are at least as extreme as the observed sample statistic.

Null hypothesis ($H_0$): the skeptical perspective; no difference; no change; no effect; random chance; what the researcher hopes to prove is **wrong**.

Alternative hypothesis ($H_A$): the new perspective; a difference/increase/decrease; an effect; not random chance; what the researcher hopes to prove is **correct**.

Null value: the value of the parameter when we assume the null hypothesis is true (labeled as $parameter_0$).

Null distribution:  the simulated or modeled distribution of statistics (sampling distribution) we would expect to occur if the null hypothesis is true.

P-value: probability of seeing the observed sample data, or something more extreme, assuming the null hypothesis is true.

$\implies$ Lower the p-value the stronger the evidence AGAINST the null hypothesis and FOR the alternative hypothesis.

Decision: a determination of whether to 'reject' or 'fail to reject' a null hypothesis based on a p-value and a pre-set level of significance.

Significance level ($\alpha$): a threshold used to determine if a p-value provides enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis or not.

\rgi Common levels of $\alpha$ include 0.01, 0.05, and 0.10.

Statistically significant: results are considered statistically significant if the p-value is below the significance level.

Confidence interval: a process to determine how large an effect is; a range of plausible values for the parameter. Also called ‘estimation’.

Margin of error: the value that is added to and subtracted from the sample statistic to create a confidence interval; half the width of a confidence interval.

Bootstrapping: the process of drawing with replacement $n$ times from the original sample.

Bootstrapped resample: a random sample of size $n$ from the original sample, selected with replacement.

Bootstrapped statistic: the statistic recorded from the bootstrapped resample.

Confidence level: how confident we are that the confidence interval will capture the parameter.
