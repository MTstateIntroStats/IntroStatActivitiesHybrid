# Probability

## Vocabulary Review and Key Topics

* **Probability**: the long-run proportion of an event

* **Conditional probability**: probabilities calculated dependent on a another event

* **Probability notation**:

    * $P(A)$: the probability of event A
    
        - This is a single event, unconditional probability calculated out of the overall population
        
    * $P(A \text{and} B)$:the probability of event A and B
    
        - The is an "and" event, unconditional probability calculated out of the overall population
        
    * $P(A|B)$: the probability of event A given (conditional on) event B
    
        - This is a conditional probability calculated out of the total for event B
        
    * $P(B^c)$: the probability of event B complement
    
        - This is the opposite of event B
        
        - $P(B^c) = 1 - P(B)$
        
    * $P(B^c|A)$: the probability of event B complement given event A
    
        - This is a conditional probability calculated out of the total for event A
